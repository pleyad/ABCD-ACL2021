Rafis partner was murdered for doing/working with peace . His family suffered a great loss .
Most people travel to Europe or the Islands . Most people get a taste of the culture in those places .
I am sickened by different things . My country has done to certain people .
It also was enlightening too how Colonel said that he barely fired his weapon in Afghanistan .
People would 've been killed . Places would have been bombed . There would have been so much going on all at once .
I do n't really agree too much about it having to do with body structure .
Both guests helped . Us understand the condition . The condition is happening in Afghanistan .
Sam mentioned was a very beneficial idea .
It was very minimal . He did have to experience some form of conflict .
The husband is a black male . The wife is white with blonde hair . The wife is white with fair skin .
Everyone has their own interpretation . There are somethings . Somethings should be universally accepted .
If religion is saying these things how come people fight each other over religion ?
You hit the nail here .
Its not a constant fight , day in and day out like . He said . I never really gave . It much thought other .
Afghan civilians are not an abstract idea . Afghan civilians need to be recognized as people . This was just like you . This was just like me .
And how much do we think about it ?
I completely agree with your thoughts . I completely is putting ourselves .
This helped me to connect the people .
Daniel agree with several of your opinions . Daniel is i . I 'm not sure . We can really solve this issue .
Most of them are people similar to people in the United States . They are just trying to survive .
These people are just like us . We need to see that .
Two of my cousins enlisted . Two of my cousins have served/are serving multiple terms .
That is a perfect word to describe Afghan civilians after hearing the story of the Lieutenants experience in Afghan .
You said .
Wars affect so many people . We are too caught up in our lives to really realize whats going on in other countries and try to help them or at least support them .
Sam shows a graph of the number of civilians . Civilians were killed over time .
They deserve to be thought of . They helped .
I may not understand the politics . I may not understand the necessities of continuing the war . No civilians want the war .
There are obviously a lot of things . Civilians do n't know about war . Most have never been in one .
Race plays a huge part in peoples lives . This is . Abigail said .
Most of the time we would only see the perspective of a minority .
The interactive aspect of technology has more pros .
I know the feeling of coldness . Someone is from New York City .
Afghanistan has had conflict . They are a lot like us .
I do wish they could explain what they saw because I really found no defining characteristics .
We have dedicated billions of dollars and thousands of men to fighting in this conflict .
Families are losing loved ones and people . Rafi want . Peace are being threatened .
This lecture really made me think about things , can we change the narrative ?
I am a mixed race because my mom is Korean . My dad is white , so Im a product of a mixed-race couple .
Wars just seem so useless . New inventions just seem so useless . All the things that we are doing right now just seem so useless .
It was shaped from a cultural historys timeline . A cultural historys timeline remembers all injustice . A cultural historys timeline remembers war . A cultural historys timeline remembers hardship .
Will we ever see peace come to fruition ?
I ca n't help . I think about how different my life would be if I was growing up knowing nothing but life with war .
The kindness of the Afghan people really surprised him . He was deployed in Afghanistan .
But in the video , Rafi was saying about something more complicated .
He lost the people . He loved most in this world .
How they invite you in to have a cup of tea .
Central and South Americans tend to be more inclined to play soccer .
The sad part is people . Dont realize . Regular civilians are being hurt by the war the most people .
War is injuring innocent people . Innocent people is not necessary .
But if we push the question even further , whats the point of doing all these stuffs ?
I wish . Race did not have such a large societal impact . It did not exist . That is not realistic .
When we are young . So many of us continue to fall into the same trap and let our view and judgement be clouded by false propaganda .
It is interesting to me . Sam knew about them because of the Twitter feed .
It shows how innocent these people are and that war should never be a solution .
I do believe there are necessity for war . Evil needs to be battled with force .
All was the China 30 years ago when we were going through a culture revolution . They see All about China .
Seeing the graph of the number of civilians killed each year was scary .
How fortunate we are to live in America .
It is a breathtaking realization . Each of our personal problems in this country are significantly smaller than we think .
He tied it back to his religion . He made the point that continuing to be angry about what happened is not going to change anything .
Is it to dilute the fact that we are over there bombing and killing people who are , in reality , not that different from us ?
A common ground of understanding would help these issues to be resolved by allowing everyone to begin to truly see the real meanings behind gestures such as the cup of tea .
We need to come together and stop the race barriers .
It makes it easier for us to empathize with the Iraqi and Afghan people . A tragedy like this is made personal .
My parents are Indian . Maybe I just have more respect . Maybe I understanding of Asian people , but a lot of this wasnt new information to me .
But should we risk the lives of Americans ?
A war was taking place in the country . It didnt feel real to me until the images . Firsthand stories were revealed .
It will make civilians feel safer in these areas , knowing what the soldiers are doing to protect them .
The insight was very valuable to us . He provided The insight .
I always thought of Afghanistan . It be from movies or television . It whatever .
The controversy over dating outside a race is fading out with each new generation .
I can not even begin to imagine what he was feeling at that moment .
I completely agree with what you are saying .
It makes people uncomfortable sometimes .
They are being sent into war .
It is often over looked . Real families just like . Us still live there .
Another reason people do not quite understand . Soldiers is the fact . You can not really relate .
It 's not fair . A culture can be viewed so negatively without even being given a chance to prove themselves because nobody really travels there .
That probably already exists . Something oriented towards learning and understanding would actually be beneficial , perhaps facilitated by universities .
One day we will all live in TRUE harmony . Education continues to reach the poorer areas of our world .
That reminded me . Sam talked about Rafi . Sam was coming here with half a suitcase full of gifts .
LTC Garey was engaging with civilians and security forces . LTC Garey took on a new perspective .
I also thought . The class when we talked about race and sports was a very interesting one as well .
He shows the graphical statistics of the military and Afghanistan deaths . All rise high above zero the graphical statistics of the military and Afghanistan deaths .
Warfighting is something . You are actively part of it . Very few Americans understand .
This is a scary reality for me to think about because I have been so privileged my whole life by living in the United States that I always feel safe at home and never fear that one day a country will come in dropping bombs in my neighborhood .
People have stereotypes about Chinese people -LRB- but I do like math a lot -RRB- .
Why would this man do what he does even though he constantly gets death threats ... why would he put his life on the line ?
I am sure that there are many Afghans . Many Afghans are kind at heart . The soldier said .
I do n't think . I would ever be able to be as hopeful and as optimistic as him .
Then as Sam mentioned I started realizing that all the lower end jobs seem to have people with a slightly darker skin .
It seemed . We had .
US is not helping other countries . US is bombing their cities . US is hurting their civilians .
To see that the people were against the Taliban was something . I wasnt expecting something .
One student when he raised his hand during the class did make a very good point . A very good point was sometimes people play sports based on availability .
Sam makes . What happens across the seas they made for themselves . Is tearing apart actual people and their lives the seas .
Feeling safe is living in the US . Feeling safe seems like a right .
This was . The village leader was able to talk to the soldier in an area where other people -LRB- who were Taliban -RRB- could not hear .
Maybe it goes back to slave labor .
The elder people in town would even invite strangers .
Soccer is the most popular sport . It depends what country in Latin America .
The majority of his time was spent speaking with the locals and getting to know them . The majority of his time was spent speaking with the locals and getting to know their culture .
My post discusses some of the same ideas , none of us really take the time to educate ourselves .
I take my safety . I have never experienced such a threat and danger to my hometown .
I instantly placed myself . Rich Garey was Lieutenant Colonel . A lot of people would care .
World in conversation andPenn state students is an amazing initiative . Conversation andPenn state students are facilitating dialogues between soldiers and cadets . Conversation andPenn state students are facilitating civilians living in conflict zones .
I did not even think about the fact . People actually lived there . Rafi came to speak with us . This war was going on around them constantly .
I agree with the quote about how people tend to only remember the bad things , but never the good .
Why would he risk it ?
They did not choose to be in the middle of destruction . It is not them who are involved .
It occurred to me . There was such a thing as . There was talking about race too much . This class lecture Im not sure .
I loved seeing his perspective .
This was a very good segment . This sparked a lot of conversation and curiosity .
The number of civilian deaths is increasing . Sam showed .
It shocked me . His life is threatened every single day .
It is important to learn about other cultures because it can enhance our way of life .
This isnt the right thing to say . I always envisioned Afghan people . The turban wearing was gun holding . Gun holding was angry extremist people .
It is all about preference of what the person is looking for .
Starting dialogue is definitely the simplest . Most effective way to bring about peace .
Stories like that sell . I understand . The media chooses to selectively show them .
This is not any individuals fault . Simple evidence was shown by historical conflict .
I believe until an affirmative action is taken by someone of higher power to put an end to racism , we will continue to suffer .
It is imperative . We as Americans see past our own shores , understand their culture . We as Americans see past our own shores , understand their way of life . We as Americans actually try to understand people , understand their culture . We as Americans actually try to understand people , understand their way of life .
It is what cements the bond between men in eternal brotherhood unlike any other experience in life .
It is very easy to get caught up in the media and only look at the American heroic view of the war .
There are people just like Rafi . People just like . Rafi are peaceful and kind in Afghanistan . Afghanistan were born into the situation . People have to continue to live through it .
I feel somewhat detached from what is happening there .
We would get a lot more done here on earth . We as a human race could remember those .
Insight on a country and in a sense makes a connection . This is to us . This is to our daily life . A country is thousands of miles away .
It makes me sad to hear that these people have hopes and aspirations that their country will not always be known as one . One was filled with war .
As time goes on people will date different races more and more because it will be accepted on a greater level .
The Afghan people have families . They are providing for . They are protecting families .
The hospitality are knowing at first he was nervous with people and currently he ismissing it - craving the food . Generosity - are knowing at first he was nervous with people and currently he ismissing it - craving the food . People were offering him tea . The hospitality furthers the way . Generosity - furthers the way . I now feel the way . I now is judging a culture .
I originally was going to write about this topic because it hits very close to home .
I agree with Callie . Callie is your point . Location definitely plays a role in the sports people play . Things like culture play a role as well .
Nothing has made an impact on me quite like this .
It caused us to forget the obvious fact that Afghan people are people just like us .
I only would focus on the people . The people were trying to do harm . Talk really opened my mind .
This land is still the home to many civilians . The home to many civilians rely on the resources in their area to live .
Another thing was . Another thing made me upset . We do not hear about the people . The people are trying to do good in other countries such as Rafi 's partner . Rafi 's partner was killed . The people are trying to help women , have equality .
Listening to Sam speak about the realness of war for citizens in Afghanistan made me realize that I have not been looking at the full picture .
They would take me .
That was definitely . Before I joined the military . I can certainly understand .
Americans formed a hazy idea of how the Afghan people live . The question left unanswered . Nothing near the comprehensive understanding they really needed .
This man is definitely someone to look up to .
Was not the first thing that popped into my head . It made . Me realize . I need to be more open minded and that there are loving and courageous people .
They simply want their families and friends .
Sam also introduced Rafi . Sam also showed pictures of his children to demonstrate that people have children . Sam also showed pictures of his children to demonstrate that people have a family like people in the United States . Rafi was his friend .
I just grew up in a household . We did n't talk about race .
Before was a war zone .
When turning on the news you do n't see any of the average Afghan people . The average Afghan people were being shown .
I always tried to push the topic of racism .
It is frustrating to see the damage that our actions cause . It is also difficult to argue that we should take it away , as there are powers . Powers threaten us .
The media is a large contributing factor as well .
We do not take it as seriously as we should . Rafi talking about how much the war has affected him made . Me reevaluate the way . I think the way about war . It is so far away and not affecting our home ground .
Everyone has a type . Everyone has to find your match or soul mate . You have to be willing open to try anything your match or soul mate .
The troops were sent over there . I really did n't understand what .
Events like this happen all the time and never get recognized because it is n't getting up on the television screen .
This really taught people not to judge a culture .
Although speaking about society 's wayward views on race is a step forward , true acceptance of everyone 's races is a feat . A feat may be near impossible .
This lecture showed me . It is to have that security .
It is sad to see how the number of innocent Afghan civilians is rising year after year . Innocent Afghan civilians were killed .
My image of the middle east has always been that way because that is all . I have seen on the news etc. all . The news was magazines .
The people are often unknown with no distinguishing uniform like in the days of World War II . You are fighting The people .
He is trying his best . He , himself , is receiving death threats .
We should always have empathy towards people in warzones .
I totally agree with everything ! . You said everything .
The bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki . We pictured . She mentioned .
People forget that there are civilians , but the war and to a certain extent the media start to paint a universal image and thinking about the people of a certain nation at war . Civilians live like everyone else in these war zones .
The first thing people notice . Me is the color of my skin .
I would have a very difficult time . I was living under the same circumstances as the Afghan people . I give them the utmost respect for trying to continue on their everyday lives despite all . All is going on around them .
Media have influenced us to not care about people themselves , but the population as a number . Other factors have influenced us to not care about people themselves , but the population as a number .
They may be small and hard to notice . They are there . This is . The end everyone has different features .
Rafi 's family really showed me . Muslim 's are like us .
Innocent civilian people have been hurt . This was in almost every war . We have fought .
I always thought . More American soldiers were getting killed during the war . A significantly higher number of civilians in Afghanistan were killed than American soldiers .
They are different that people in the US for that specific reason .
I like . Afghanistan is a place with with real people .
I never had a personal reason to be invested in the subject .
The first thing is something . I thought about before . I never took much time . Much time was contemplating .
Simply spreading the word is an easy first step to promoting world peace . This is to not judge people .
If he does n't do it . It will .
I had no idea that the American troops were in so much contact with the Afghan people and that most of these encounters were friendly and inviting in nature .
So this makes it hard for whites to talk about their opinion .
Black people have a better body structure to play basketball . Example was the first person to point out that .
They have families and jobs . They loved ones , just like us .
Well , it is mainly . We cant understand their lives .
Taking the village leaders offer for tea shows a sign of good faith .
People have different tastes when it comes to dating .
Race is not talked about to much .
I agree with your point . I have done some of the things . You have mentioned the things .
We do not talk about racism enough in the right ways .
White privilege exists . White privilege is alive and well .
You can not look at history . You can not see a moment . Racism hasnt been around .
I had only heard violent things . I was scared for him .
Children live in these conflict zones . Children go to school . Children play around with friends . Children experience a childhood as well .
A large part of why civilians dont and will probably never understand what it is like to go to war is . They have no one to help them understand war . They have no thing to help them understand war .
He did not understand . It was much more than that . The elder was offering . Him was not merely a cup of tea . The Lieutenant Colonel did not understand the customs of the Afghan people .
This idea leads me . This is into my next point of understanding that we have a hard time that the media dresses up for us . A hard time is connecting . We are simply not in the same area . We can only perceive information .
I did not consider . People in Afghanistan have even more drive and reason to work to improve their own country because of how many people from other countries go over to Afghanistan .
Media has the power to influence how people see other cultures and what they can learn about them .
If you put that in perspective think of how we would being acting if this war was going on here and our lives were endangered like that every single day .
That does not mean . Every means to serve their nation resorts .
I often subconscious look at people . I often subconscious think about how I am either very similar or different to that individual .
I have had a lot of experiences with different races . I can understand a persons background .
I am in agreement with Raf . I support the end of the war . It is causing mass destruction for really no reason .
Sam made .
I think you make a really good point .
Culture awareness lets . We are trying to make peace .
It is important to remember we are all humans with our own needs , wants , and cares .
We as Americans tend to forget what war is and think it is just a thing .
The word generosity does not do justice .
Sam really got me thinking when he showed us the life in Afghanistan .
Just to be happy throughout our life time and live up to our own conscience .
I do not think people understand that this is an actual country just like ours .
But during the war , both sides of the troops need to consider the outcome of using massively destructive weapons because they can hurt really people .
Listening to the stories about the village elders coming out and offering tea and welcoming the soldiers was something . Something really made . Me wonder .
I grew up in a very diverse community and school district therefore .
The Afghanistan war began in 2001 . The Afghanistan war has spanned the majority of my life .
I did not think that far back .
It was very interesting to hear from everyday people in a country that many think is supposed to be one of our enemies .
We do n't feel empathy for things . Things do not directly affect us .
There was a huge push including town halls to get people to vote .
I typically dont ask many questions at all .
I thought . He used his slides well to illustrate just how similar everyone is , and how people in Afghanistan are just trying to get along with their daily lives just like anyone else .
Civilians who can not defend themselves from war .
It all was just very eye opening and thought . Eye opening and thought were provoking for me .
It is these passionate people . We need to make those final votes count .
Just because someone looked different than white Americans , how does that make them any less of a human .
It is different one someone tells you statistics about war , that it kills fifty percent of innocent civilians and that there are bombings every day .
I personally had not thought about how the civilians have to act sometimes in order to survive all that they have .
We do not have the right to generalize that all Afghans only think about war because we do not know many Afghans .
What Drives You To Do What You Do ?
I did like when Sam invited his friend to talk about his experience as a soldier .
Me personally . I do n't know . I would 've been able to accept that at first I would 've been seeking revenge .
War takes place . It be a large populated city . It be some small village . Some small village lies between two mountains .
I could not imagine living in such terror .
Racism was always the uncomfortable topic . It is one of the longest and biggest internal conflict . The longest and biggest internal conflict seems . We can never fix .
War to an eighteen year old kid from Central PA seems like such a foreign concept in a place . Central PA has never considered enlisting in the military . Doesnt haven anything to lose from the war .
It was not in this particular video . It highlighted . We are not at war with the country of Afghanistan . We are not at war with the country of the Afghan people . LTC Garey talked about the village elder offering him tea in his home .
He could very easily keep quiet and could you really blame him ?
I think about poverty , death , and war . I am guilty of forgetting that these places have real people just like anywhere else . Anywhere else want no part in the war . Afghanistan comes to mind . Afghanistan is the word .
This is something . People forget .
She is helping us start a dialogue .
These are usually people , they are brought in into the war . People just want better for their country , but because of ignorance and hate .
It is also interesting to view issues of war from the other perspective .
Today I do n't think . Most people would think of vacationing in Afghanistan for obvious reasons .
I totally agree with what you said that race is beautiful .
No one in my family or extended family has ever really joined the army/navy/marines . No one in my family or extended family was / etc. .
You bring up an interesting point when addressing the fact that many Afghan people did not have as much hate in their hearts as we would anticipate . Many Afghan people were emotionally damaged .
I am very open to being with someone from another race .
We are simply so lucky to live in such a privileged and free life . We often forget the struggles of other people .
I did too in that moment .
This connected me . It reminded me to think about the cultural differences .
It is such a selfless way of viewing the situation .
Achieving this is not easy feat .
I also had little knowledge of how war affects civilians in their own countries .
Something that we talked about in my discussion group was whos responsibility is it to inform us ?
We are the great heroes of the world . The world is always ready to save the day .
My dad had the same experience with Afghan people . They were always generous and hospitable .
We can not truly understand what exactly is happening somewhere else . We experience it our self . We experience it at least hear stories .
It is also important for Americans to hear this perspective as we consider what military tactics . We are using in the region military tactics .
It goes to show that being modernized does not particularly make a civilization happy .
It would take me a while . I met . Millions of people of different races first-hand . Millions of people of different races became friends .
I 'm sure most of us would n't feel comfortable having tea with a stranger in a village there but that 's kind of upsetting because it 's almost that the culture is too welcoming for us Americans .
Assuming we ever fully understand a culture is dangerous and can lead to even more problems .
Its not fair to assume things about people only based on a generalization .
All of this is greater than his fear of the daily death threats that he receives , and for that he is inspirational .
The last thing was his story . The last thing really struck me . He mentioned towards the end of the video .
I know a lot of mixed race couples . They are wonderful .
I still am-but . I have a different outlook on life .
We dont really understand the extent of the war . Our military are the ones . The ones are fighting for us .
It makes it easier to cope with so much death .
Is it even more arrogant when you are the reason that most of the problems are occurring in said country .
This is the topic . The topic comes up in class a lot . We tend to generalize that all of a certain group act the same way .
A man was going to put something .
It is interesting to learn about what their life is like .
I agree with everything .
This is not the first time . This has happened the first time .
We all need to see beyond the media , people in countries like Afghanistan are living their lives .
I am not sure how but most of us somehow disconnect from humanity and what the real world is like .
Not only do we get the privilege of living without war , but are not taught why the war has even began .
The main issue though is . We are fighting a war .
One day people will all soon realize . The people there are n't different than the people here .
It was surprising . The Afghani hospitality was welcoming .
We do need to make the topic more open to help educate society better and that will hopefully start getting rid of racism .
Not only were there possible spies out listening to them , but that was not apart of his culture .
We can find ways to support people . People 's lives have been affected by wars and conflicts .
People do not understand that today . Life is supposed to be a competition . Race does not define us .
He was there in the first place to find out who was in the Taliban not to have tea .
Every year the numbers get higher and higher . Higher is scary for the people living in that country . Higher is scary for the people living in that country .
We can not just ignore race . You said . It comes with setbacks .
It is likely this could never be fully traced back . It is an interesting thought to juggle .
I understand that bad thing is happening but that is only half of the story !
The point was when Sam said hockey is a Northern sport and that more white people lived in the North when it originated , he is right that is culture and location . The point was so clear .
I chose ? . The video clip Are Sports Inherently Racist .
It has to do a lot .
It says a lot more about a culture when it is suffering from war . Its people still welcome outsiders . This is into their home because of their morals . This is into their home because of their beliefs .
We all can learn something very positive .
They are not an abstract concept . Our soldiers inhabit every once an abstract concept . An abstract concept live in an isolated bubble .
It is both unfortunate but relieving . I was not the only one . The only one was so ignorant or incorrect about what war zones were actually like .
It was not in this particular segment . Eventually Garey talks about his meeting . Garey is Lieutenant .
Is it even possible for there to be no war ?
You is stubborn . They are . You can not change them .
The only difference was the threat of the Taliban . The United States forces looming over the citizens .
Its a shame that those stereotypes exist .
I do n't think . My parents ever saw it . An issue needed to be discussed with me .
This really allowed us to know what living there is like .
Where this ignorance stems from .
I enjoyed hearing about the average Afghanistan citizen as well , because I feel like I have continued to hear skewed info throughout my life .
It is so sad . They being affected by war and terror .
It is hard to resist if all have been filtered . We learn and know all .
Who will help bring peace to his country and to his family if he did n't try to do something to stop the violence ?
Another aspect that I think really brainwashes people . Another aspect that I think really was having this interpretation of what war is , is the education . We are raised up on the education .
Families forged from fire tend to have the tendency to have stronger and closer relationship as . This was compared to families . Families were forged from bloodline .
You need to see all sides not just one .
Its hard to explain to someone . Someone is your excitement to go out on patrol .
A better understanding of culture allows for a more worldly perspective . A more worldly perspective reduces . A more worldly perspective even eliminates any sort of fear .
Many war zones were civilian homes first . They are not meant to be hurt . They are .
So we should stop judging them . That is far from what they are .
People may think of Afghanistan of a place of terror and war . There are normal civilians . Normal civilians live there . That is . Their families are from .
But I do agree with you . But I do hope more people got comfortable with this discussion topic as well .
We stand up for what we believe in . We is causing turmoil and issues .
Some do not even see the battle field . This is . I said .
It may not be the safest place to visit .
They probably would not have been thrilled at the people . The people were coming into their land . Maybe there would have been some amicable agreement .
Like it is time that we see something other than people with guns and terrorizing .
War is a terrible thing . War is we . Americans need to realize how hard the war is on others and be see it .
Im always scared to bring up some sort of touchy subject or ask a question that they do not want to think about .
Speaking to Bassim opened my eyes and broke my heart .
Then you think , what did he do to deserve to live in acountrythat gets bombed and blown up often ? .
I did n't realize . These middle east countries had nice homes . These middle east countries had the middle class existed .
It 's not everyday you get to talk to people or let alone a citizen of Afghanistan . People have experienced the culture in Afghanistan .
It was nice to see his views of the country change . He spent time there .
I appreciate your post . I is giving a full understanding that there is a miscommunication with the way people perceive Afghanistan .
It always comes down to my race . It comes to school a sport . A sport is etc. . School is a job .
We see . It pop up in the news more often . It has lead .
How Rafi was raising his daughters . They were growing up in a war zone .
I never truly new soldiers may come out of the experience making relationships and building a connection with this opposing nation .
They do n't really carry the weight of what it means to suffer and hurt .
Personally I do n't think . It is eye opening . Personally I do n't make a white person realize how hard it is in every aspect . Personally I is for an African American .
When U.S. military involvement began in Afghanistan .
We are taught growing up that countries such as Afghanistan are war-torn countries where their cities are strictly for battle .
Seeing Rich Gary in person was very impressive in my opinion as he talked freely about his time and experience in Afghanistan . Rich Gary was Lieutenant Colonel .
I do not see this issue ever subsiding .
There was a con about the snarky comments . Sam immediately addressed the situation . Sam immediately shut it down .
This love may not be big enough to end wars at first . It could definitely stop bullies . It could definitely promote a kinder society .
Not living in that effects area can make you feel very disconnected .
I finally realized . Some of the people are not that different than me . The people live in Afghanistan . Sam showed us the pictures of the city and traffic jams and shopping mall .
There were children . Children were killed . Children were families . Families lost everything and people . Families were getting killed for no reason . Children were killed .
We all have ingrained insecurities . Most of us would change something . She is proud to be exactly who she is . The chance is . It was so empowering to hear .
It is important to learn and listen to realize that people in Afghanistan are real people .
There are a ton of innocent people . A ton of innocent people are getting harmed from this war . This war is beyond unnecessary . They are just trying to live their lives .
Many families were killed . Many families where basically left for dead .
Even I thought . Civilians would be okay . They are not part of the war . We talked about how real people are being affected by this war .
It is mind . Mind is blowing .
An average citizen spend their day . An average citizen is fearing . Such an attack could bring . Ever does .
This being said , it is easy to see why no progress can be made with so many countries . So many countries were involved .
We see it . Americans will never sincerely accept the fact . They were one of the biggest villains . The world has ever seen .
We are fortunate enough to not have any war fought on our soil .
My graduating high school class had 130 students . There was only one black person . There was one Asian .
The question is why is war a continuing thing ? . The question always comes to mind .
I also did not entirely know . A modern Afghanistan looked like .
But that was my hometown . My parents were living in .
Words are words . Situations are situations .
Bassims story definitely sheds light on the unintended effect of the United States foreign policy of drone strikes in the Middle East .
There is a perspective . The American policy caused him massive loss . The American policy caused him grieving . He does n't think . Our country has the capacity to change its course .
It was . Richards began to talk about the war in Afghanistan . Richards was Dr. .
I specifically want to talk about the war in Afghanistan , it is the longest conflict in U.S history .
I never seemed to notice that part about war .
I saw these chlildren . They have this warm spirit . They are so happy .
Racism will continue to exist 100 years .
It is easy to get a warped view of what is happening in other parts of the world . We are disconnected from each other . We are see what the news shows us .
I have heard about it . Who is fighting who .
It was good . Garey was when speaking about his first thoughts on Afghanistan . Garey was honest Lieutenant .
My prayers go out to rafi . My prayers go out to his family and everyone living in a war zone .
I also agree with the fact about how just like people in the US want freedom and peace , Rafi wants it too .
This lecture was very eye . Very eye was opening for me as well . I look forward to broadening my view on the current war .
They may not have much . They are still willing to give and help .
I am from Ethiopia and when I came here like most African Americans I have faced certain things but that comes with the history of the country that I am black . I am from Ethiopia and when I came here like most African Americans I have faced certain things but that comes with the history of the fact that I am black .
I personally had never thought about the implications of war . It is local .
I again put myself . I couldnt imagine saying goodbye to my father every morning , like it was my last time . My last time was seeing him .
I would say . War can beneficial in its own way . War is not good . It comes down to it .
When is somebody going to take the courage to finally begin to implement actions to solve this .
My view on war is simply just a representation of the lack of empathy . Ive been raised to have with such simplicity . Ive a lack of worry about my home land .
Mushroom cloud were common responses . Houses and buildings torn apart were common responses .
I knew as much as most Americans . Most Americans is . Its a country that has been a battlefield for a long time .
This lecture opened up my mind to sympathize for the majority of people in Afghanistan as they are innocent and how asmall amountof people there are evil .
My teachers mentioned it . I would see it . I never really took the time myself . Myself in this case is my responsibility .
Real people are being affected here .
This most definitely opened up my eyes . This most definitely showed me . We truly are .
Fearing those people lead us to not giving them a chance to be learned about and appreciated as a nation .
But that is not true . Afghanistan is a country of almost 35 million people . A country of almost 35 million people is a large number . But there is no way that all of those people are bad .
Soldiers would have developed a special bond . Soldiers had been served in Afghan .
The world is only going to get worse . Everyone is always fighting and arguing .
It is 2017 . It seems . Things have not changed .
My oldest cousin left . I was young , but old enough to comprehend how dangerous a war can be .
Rafi is a prime example . Not all Afghans are in favor of the Taliban . Not all Afghans are in the war in general .
Categorizing people makes things simpler . It can be unfair .
My mind drifts towards the negative ideas . This is such as terrorism . This is such as violence . This is such as the home . Awful people target and attack the US .
I am very quick to judge to an extent . I need to work on that .
How Raf and his wife have communicated their situation to their two beautiful girls .
The very first thing just hit me kind of hard . Our class was . He was a peaceful man . He was this The very first thing .
The next thing shattered my previous opinion even more . The lieutenant said The next thing .
We need to remove all preconceived notions . All preconceived notions are brought about through stereotypes and misinformation .
Another story was the story of the man . The man made . LT come in for a cup of teas . He would share information . Another story connected me .
The fact that our country was founded on racism definitely is a huge reason why we think the way . We do today the way .
This video really opened my eyes up to these concepts of war . This video really showed me a different side of war .
They did not mean every man .
This is one of the most powerful statements Ive . The most powerful statements Ive were heard thus far in class .
They do n't deserve for people . They just want to live normal lives like we do .
Talked about Martin Luther King and how he changed the lives of many people . Just learning how others can be different than ourselves .
I was never directly affected by war . Our army tends to be always be fighting over seas . There is never a war in our homeland .
But when I heard Garey share his story about how individuals were accepting and a man even invited him into his home for tea was amazing . Garey was Lieutenant .
They are poor . They do not live normal lives .
I found this point in class interesting as well . I agree with you .
They have jobs . Jobs are trying to make away just like we are .
This question has been overlooked for too long .
It really was surprising to hear about the constant threat that Raf is living in while just doing his job .
Educate someone to respect someone else and there would be no problem with differences .
It is important for speech therapists to understand that so we dont provide them with inadequate services due to the fact . We dont know something .
It seems like a hopeless cause when the superpowers of the world are at war and you are just one person .
I automatically think of war . I automatically see images of my parents . I hear . Someone say Afghanistan .
It was just interesting to have the lens switched because obviously most Christians do n't agree with the extremist groups and the same goes for Muslims .
You raised a lot of good points involving race in our culture .
but what I think is more important is that we can never imagine the influence in between the people after they gone through all these together .
Ive even heard plenty of stories of Afghani families . Plenty of stories of Afghani families would invite service members . Ive even wishes .
His whole life he has been threatened by the current war in afghanistan .
Because Ive never said goodbye to my parents and worried about them being assassinated that day .
He did not do anything wrong . He was targeted . His family was murdered .
I like your quote . If we fail to learn from it .
This obviously is n't true . The media does n't portray the positive aspects of the country of what it actually used to be before war broke out .
If people know the number of civilians in Afghanistan is increasing why is there nothing happening to help decrease those numbers . Afghanistan is being killed .
Maybe that was just the military person in him . The military person in him was always trying to be aware and smart about things . I would have done the same too .
The conversation between Basim and our SOC 119 class is one . I willalways remember .
I is going off of what you said . I find myself wondering why people do n't just get up and leave as well .
I also do n't believe we talk about race too much in America .
It certainly is visible . More black people participate in basketball . White people lean towards hockey .
The other thing is at my school , we do n't have hockey . There were basic sports my school . Hockey is lacrosse etc. . Lacrosse is swimming .
All is related to the ongoing war there . All is related to nothing about the people . We hear All in the news today about Afghanistan . Nothing about the people are being affect by this war .
Two very good reasons for war . War ended up being completely false .
We can not forget it .
It is affecting the innocent citizens of Afghanistan . Is rarely thought of when it comes to both the decisions of the U.S. and the Taliban .
They are happy . They thats the life . They know the life .
I never seemed to realize that war really does affect real people .
I had little understanding of what life as a soldier is like .
Learning about the country should be a requirement for the US military . You are going to occupy the country .
One thing that I wish would have been mentioned in this discussion by Sam was our Penn State reads book , It 's . I do by Lynsey Addario .
The media is biased to show images and videos of war . War was torn . War torn were destitute shots .
White people tend .
These movies display a Hollywood version of the Middle East . A Hollywood version of the Middle East is very different from what it is really like .
I selected . Garey was LTC .
The first thing is . The first thing should be established . We are all humans . We should be treated in humane ways .
I was taken back at the fact . A majority of this soldiers time was not on a battlefield . LTC Garey said this . Simply interacting with others in the country that he was fighting .
He still continues to lead a normal life , and from what I saw . A normal life was seemed to feel content . His life is now the way .
We can try our best . There is always going to be a group , individual , community reversing our progress .
People all over the world may be going through tough situations/issues . Everyone handles it differently .
Maybe the educational system is very Eurocentric .
You are hard pressed to find interviews with the actual grunts on the ground . The ground truly shows you . It is like .
We seem to be taught as a country that all Afghan people are violently , vicious , mean , etc. .
These children are brought up learning their cultures values . Their cultures values are often very different from American cultural values . Their cultures values are often very different from social norms .
Being a soldier was about intelligence training and teaming up with the locals . I had no idea . That actually was .
Then Afghanistan would not have such a negative war connotation . The news would have shown events . The news would let them know what is actually going on overseas .
All was Mahatma Gandhi . All was a few protests . It took All for independence .
It is predominantly white . I use to think that race wasnt an issue . I go to Argentina .
The men of the town were gathering to discuss the importance of voting .
He can not just wait around . He can not just let other people take action . Rafi mentioned .
Learning about the hospitality of Afghan people encourages me to try to be a better person in that way .
It make complete sense . The elder would be supporting the group . His family would be supporting the group . The group had the most power . They are the ones . The ones can do more damage . The elder go against them .
I like the part of your response . The war may eat such cultures and values up .
The fact that we do not completely know the other culture makes it even more interesting to share and communicate .
The Middle East is portrayed far differently in the media . This was . You said .
The bible is Gods written rules .
There should be so much more accountability for not educating yourself .
Civilians , whether or not they want to , are affected by this war greatly .
They should have the same experience . We had in class with the two guests . The two guests spoke .
The soldiers interpreted it . The soldiers made the decision to kill the kids and put out the gas .
They have the same dreams and goals as us like . They is going to school . They is getting a job . They is having a family one day .
The point is really important . You said The point about media not knowing everything but wanting the public to think they know everything .
You always see the people . This is with the big guns . The big guns are walking around looking very intimidating .
I began to wonder why . He was a lawyer in this country . This country was trying to create laws and regulations to decrease the violence in Afghanistan .
These citizens were at the wrong place at the wrong time . These citizens were walking to work . These citizens were getting . Their day started . Little Boy was dropped .
I too , have never experienced a college class . Social media has been advocated to this extent .
It 's also interesting to see how friendly the Afghan people are to the american soldiers .
I agree with you . I is feeling outrage .
It is hard to imagine it as a prospering place with families as we do when all is images of poor children . It is hard to imagine it as a prospering place with families as we do when all is images of war and deserts . We are exposed to all . Families have the same dreams .
What can we do to ensure that war wont affect innocent civilians ?
We live in . This is in our Sociology119 class . We are giving an opportunity to enrich ourselves with more Penn State . Penn State is knowledge about the world .
Bassim has survived unthinkable atrocities .
Every war has been fought on foreign soil . Every war has preceded this .
Then when asking yourself that question it 's impossible to answer because he does n't deserve that .
I understand your feelings .
I do chalk a lot of the issue up to ignorance .
Every nation has its own fascinating cultures . Every nation values .
We do n't have battles and bloodshed on our own land . Our own land 's what happens to other people , miles and oceans away .
I cant imagine having to constantly worry about whats . Whats are going to happen next since its pretty much a war zone .
How could you be expected to forgive a country that bombed your home , your dog , your family ?
I grew up in an extremely safe and close knit community . Walking around alone at 11 pm felt perfectly safe .
I am guilty of thinking that way as well .
The people and events of Afghanistan became more real for me . The people and events of Afghanistan were watching this video .
There is more to the job of a soldier . Most people recognize .
I know from personal experience one of my history teachers . This was in high school . High school was made it a point of emphasis .
He does . He does . It is his responsibility .
Learning about other cultures intrigues me . It seems tough to know where to start unless you can talk to someone from that culture .
Raf was a great guest . It is amazing to see someone fighting for peace amid all the war .
We would want it to end to . The war was switched . The war was occurring in America .
He is a hero . War was a traumatic experience .
Something that he said had a shocking impact on me . He spoke .
I was trying to put myself . He went through that list .
He then shows us Afghanistan broken up into its different districts and states how the districts are split up kind of like our own states .
Afghanistan has bustling cities with crowded streets and traffic jams and shopping malls . American cities do .
We always tend to look down at places like Afghanistan when in reality , there are a few things that Americans should learn from them . We always tend to look down at places like such when in reality , there are a few things that Americans should learn from them .
I went to a Model United Nation Conference . I was talking about South China Sea issues .
The Tea Story was extremely impactful and interesting . You said . I completely agree .
He needs to be able to spread his experiences to both civilians and cadets alike .
The vast majority of us here at Penn State have absolutely not idea would have another day to spend with your loved ones . It would feel like to wake , or whether or not you idea . If you would live to see the next .
The great people of Afghanistan are seeking peace .
Just trying to imagine what they go through daily is impossible .
I could not even imagine being in those civilian shoes because what is being done to them is something . No one should ever have to deal with something .
From an outsiders ' perspective , would n't that seem a little extreme ?
When you said that US does not talk about any branch of security openly with other countries .
How would be to spend a day in the shoes of ______ culture .
Every country deals with its own issues . There are positive sides to the story as well .
The constant remembrance of these hard times can lead us to be more fearful and lash out leading .
He was more thankful that he is alive today to talk about his experience rather than being bitter about the events . The events occurred in the past .
A lot of this can be attributed to the way media presents . The way media presents is actually going on in the world .
They have to appease those in control to stay alive .
All is awareness . It takes All .
I can admit I fail all of the identification games we play and Sam calls out to the white people to make a point , I am 100 % his audience . Sam is every time .
I wish . I had enough courage to do what this man is doing in order to help others .
What can I do ?
And how much do we care ?
I do not watch a lot of news . I do not keep up with a lot of current events in our world . Side of the story is never even spoken about . That is . I had never put the thought .
All of these small details allow me to make connections . My own traditions and family values makes . The people of Afghanistan seem even more alike to my family than I ever imagined . The people of Afghanistan seem even more alike to I than I ever imagined .
I do not agree with treating people like lab rats .
Most of this racial tension in conversation results in certain groups not feeling their opinions are worth being heard , while other groups are worried that theyll overly offend another group .
This particular story struck me . It showed . It is for the US military .
I have sometimes turned the blind . I am a white male . I am not sure what to say or do because I fear I will offend someone or make things worse .
When Rafi was talking to us about his life , and how similar it was to ours , thats when it hit me !
The media is the major influence on most people from different countries around the world .
We need to do a better job .
Just one of the many blessings of being born into the right nation .
Yet here we are over 25 years later . Yet we are seeing more of these headlines in the news .
I originally had trouble understanding . He would stay in that situation . Rafi was receiving death threats . Richards was Dr. .
Whereas in American culture , speaking up and answering questions in class is seen as a good thing .
Sitting through this lecture has taught me so much and has changed my perspective . My perspective . My is happening .
So why is it so hard for us to see that ?
One thing that I love about this class , is . It allows us the opportunity to talk about issues and topics . About issues and topics may be taboo or difficult conversations .
I thought . This class was particularly interesting . Like the war in Afghanistan is an issue that people forget is even still going on .
That is the side of warfare . Society never gets to learn or hear about . More people should be told those types of stories .
Looking at the war and thinking about how citizens of Afghanistan must feel has really changed my perception of war .
The example of India is one of the best examples of the military not understanding the culture . They are working with the culture .
The story that the Lieutenant Colonel told us is a very powerful example of that .
He still holds a job . He still has friends . He still lives his life normally .
So , do we talk about race too much ?
That goal is universal . That goal is applicable to what people want in the U.S. as well .
Not everyone there is violent . Not everyone lives .
He could walk away from trying to stand up against the Taliban and let other people continue to try to take care of it .
Terrorist groups do not need fighting soldiers to be their targets .
He always were jerseys to school . He loved the Celtics .
One thing that I realized from listening to LTC Garey is . I really think I misinterpreted what being at war entails .
All in all enjoy . I did really all . I was able to dive into the current news in high school . I do believe that everyone can do a better job to educate themselves on what places of war are actually like .
I thought . Ahmad Rafi did a wonderful job of giving our class a clear view into the mind of an Afghan citizen .
It is almost hard not to be mad at myself for being closed minded enough to think that Afghan people are completely different from me . It is almost hard not to be mad at myself for being closed minded enough to think that Afghan people are completely different from you . I am just glad that I gained a little bit more insight about Afghan people from this lecture .
I read news articles every day . I still do not have a clear picture of what the U.S. is doing in the Middle East .
Only a minimal amount of the class could be used for current events . I did appreciate . He would talk about modern news every class .
He is talking about something like a dream . A dream was a long-term goal . A long-term goal might never be achieved in his life time .
There are two sides . To take two sides .
I always picture war . I always is shooting one another . That was the extent of it .
I can think of this question in different scales . That will totally lead to different answers .
I have had many thoughts . I have had ideas . I have had pictures of Afghanistan .
This story highlights the utmost importance of learning the culture of a country .
Race is important to understand and key in making America . It is America . America is today .
This man is inspiring .
This topic discussed was important because of two main realizations . This topic discussed was important because of understandings . I encountered .
One day teams will look more diverse due to sports . Sports were spreading out geographically and traditional ways being broken .
The superpowers of the world want them to keep fighting .
I am not a expert in noses . Slowing down and looking would have definitely helped him to be more accurate .
We create some false picture . We would rather think .
They have a great culture that I would not thought about learning about if we were not introduced to it this class .
It has also made me aware of the cultural exchange . The cultural exchange is a result of this .
You is having no concept of another culture . You might be nervous when interacting with someone from that culture for the first time .
Not until last year did I first start thinking about the impact of war on civilians .
Teachers should start to focus on these interactions that soldiers actually have on a day to day basis . Students and people in general can begin to grasp what it is that our American soldiers actually do every day .
My mom is no longer in the military . My dad is active duty . Both have been deployed to Afghanistan .
The U.S led . Coalition has been responsible for the deaths of many Afghan civilians . Many Afghan civilians is a fact . A fact can not be ignored as was evident from the presentation .
There is no such thing as talking about race too much .
Like everyone should be educated on what is going on .
My only wish is that somehow . Someway he finds justice . I 'm not really sure . It would ever make up for what he 's lost .
The coverage of Afghanistan on the news is what really made out a bad image for them in America .
The picture is similar to what LTC Garey says in this video . I heard Afghanistan . Afghanistan was the word . The picture would automatically come in my mind .
They might gave reasons . They was going . Where just an excuse just to go invade another country .
It was amazing . That would never happen in the United States . The situation was flipped .
I wasnt sure what to expect . Sam brought speakers .
The hardest thing is . To face about both of these books and religions The hardest thing . Sam based this video off of : interpretation .
I thought . The class on September 12th was one . I found particularly interesting .
It really makes . You think about how trivial our daily issues are compared to what people in other parts of the world are going through .
It is important . We take our own initiative .
Im wondering how others reacted to this lecture the part , and if it pulled at their heartstrings at all . The part was featured in the video .
The war has caused American troops . Some families have been left in the dark .
I naively had the wrong ideas of the Islamic faith . It was a much more complex . It was strict religion than a religion like Christianity .
Children should grow up learning the war .
It is by seeing the Afghan people as people that we will limit the amount of casualties . That will prolong the conflict .
His lack of understanding for the culture in Afghanistan delayed his objective . His lack of understanding for the culture in Afghanistan was pinpointing . The Taliban men were in the town .
They can even relate and assist our own soldiers .
White privilege is a thing . I feel that its not the answer to everything .
Social work are destroyed . Economy are destroyed . Normal life are destroyed . That was difficult to listen to .
They are the ones , they would have nothing . The ones are minding their own business so therefore .
This made . Me realize . The we are only being given half of the story .
I never looked too much into it . It didnt affect me personally .
He begins by saying that if he stops fighting who will continue ? .
I also found this portion of lecture .
The idea that someone is different naturally puts people on edge .
This was the first time . I wasnt exposed to the radical images of afghan people the first time . I realized . I was in the complete wrong . I fell into the social norm of stereotyping .
Other civilizations are generally shown in a way . A way implies certain meanings about them .
Things are not as bad . They seem .
It was genetics . I didnt know . Our features are the way that they are .
I never understood the Iraq war .
It is really hard for me to understand the amount of death and sacrifice . The amount of death and sacrifice was put into this war .
Innocent people are dying while trying to live their everyday lives .
Sams discussion made me think more about religion and that it might be interesting to read both the Bible and the Quran to get a better understanding of what the books actually tell people to believe and follow for their daily lives .
The only reason that I can tell myself is that maybe were just doing everything for our own sake .
Seeing the photo of Basim 's house made it even that much more real to me .
Im sure that the good people in the USA and the good people in Afghan all agree that we wish those awful people amongst us would just go away and stop ruining the beauty of differences .
And , it will be hard for the majority of civilians to understand what war is like . You start to see these perspectives .
He already changed my opinion of the Afghan people and . My opinion of the Afghan people and was after hearing him speak for a short period of time .
This was surprising because often times . People -LRB- including myself -RRB- associate regular people . Regular people are living in the Middle East as having a strong political position with the party often times . The party is native to their country .
I guess at the time , I really did not have much choice to choose from-talking race wise .
But these differences were taking the time to actually break down . These differences made . Me think differently about the topic of race . This was in people . People were based off of where they are from really .
So why are they only showing us the bad things that happening in Afghanistan .
It appears . It is the opposite .
We was hearing people speak about war . We was seeing the real people and families afflicted . We gain a sense of understanding and empathy . We may not have had before .
The people wanted to teach them their morals . The people wanted to teach them religion . The people wanted to teach them way of life . The people wanted to teach them overall culture so they could have a better understanding of who they truly are as a country .
The vast majority of people in power are white . This is . Sam said .
Someone will not resist the temptation to be distracted by their technology platforms . Doesnt want to be there someone . Someone will not take away . Doesnt want to be there someone . The student , gets from the class . DOES want to be there The student .
Race can have hundreds of meanings . Meanings are depending on who is talking .
Real people being affected by war .
Bassim is truly a great individual . I appreciate him and Sam coming together to have him speak to us .
I thought . It was cool that their culture is about giving , even when most have so little . We can really learn from the people of Afghanistan .
The word generosity but at Sam did . Sam was the end of his speech .
We live in the country . We have soccer . Soccer is cross country baseball . Cross country baseball is softball . Softball is track . Cross country is basketball .
It really put things . Sam started telling the story of Basim . Sam showed the pictures of his house and family .
Young have been victim to racism now . Innocent blacks have been victim to racism now .
It is amazing . Basim is able to forgive and carry on with a purpose . A purpose leads to my thought . It is very important for the people . The people do not understand the Islamic faith .
Him talked basketball all-day-every-day . His best friends talked basketball all-day-every-day . His best friends were white .
Afghanistan in the recent decade has faced war .
The citizens and people of a country at war are not always thought about .
Reason being is just imagining that they were being treated like africans americans . Reason being was the white person .
He had his own convictions . His own convictions were not so in favor of these people .
I really appreciated this discussion . It is a topic . A topic has never once even crossed my mind .
His home was completely demolished with rubble and broken pieces of concrete everywhere .
It 's really refreshing . Sam bluntly points out . We are all the same .
Firstly I could n't agree more that society is very open to interracial relationships .
This simmering discontent under the British yoke is what led to the Revolt of 1857 when several Indian men conscripted in the British army mutinied and led a nationwide revolution to eject the invaders out of India .
This is likely due to a lack of exposure to diversity .
Well see that 50 Afghanis were killed in a suicide bombing at a wedding but we cant imagine the impact of that .
I agree with your thoughts on how little we discuss Afghanistan outside of the war .
I never paused to consider the Afghan people whose homes were being invaded .
My high school was pretty diverse . Interracial dating was normal . Interracial dating accepted .
Some people feel so strongly that we have reached a point of no return with the state . We are in the state .
Maybe it is important . We take some initiative of our own to go and explore other cultures for ourselves .
Education would allow individuals to walk in someone elses shoes .
They live such different lives than I do , it wasnt weird to me . They do have such different culture .
We have no power to start , prevent or end a war .
It is so upsetting to think about how many children and families fear for their lives while doing simple everyday things or going to the grocery store .
I found his strength and humility .
Afghanistan is a real place with real people who have normal lives like any other country in the world but because if the war people are living in fear not knowing what is going to happen next .
His wife says goodbye to him everyday . He goes to work not knowing if there will be an explosion . An explosion could hurt him . An explosion could hurt his family . Rafi said .
American are being misguided ! . Like it is time for us to inform and show the people of this place and not the war ! .
I would never allow her to go through what I went through . I had to send my biracial daughter .
This man has such strong beliefs . This man demonstrates . He believes in what he is doing for his family and country by continuing his work .
The same exact thing has probably happened to many other families in Afghanistan , but no one here in America talks . The same exact thing happened to Bassim .
You cant always pin the problem . How easy they have it .
I used to think the war had more of a negative impact . It is clear . I was wrong .
I always thought . War was about the United States constantly fighting and shooting the enemy in order .
It saddens me . We live in a world . A world was divided still today .
Jordan , I feel the same exact way about Rafi and the incredible bravery he puts forth every single day of his life .
It made . Me think about how I 'd feel if a local shopping center near me were to be destroyed by a foreign military . It was hearing about the bombing .
There is obviously still problems with race in out country and no matter the color , you see it . You are the color .
It would be difficult to find the solution to the problem . Soldiers do not understand about a religion .
We all have the features to help us survive in a certain climate .
I always read about war .
Cooperation is not one . Dialogue is not one . One was sided however . Assuming the other side is welcoming especially in a war zone is a leap of faith at times .
They bounce off of each other . They bounce off of its awesome to be around .
Everyone has their own views and ideas .
He talks about his wife . Because they do not know what could happen that day .
It is absolutely unfair to the civilians . If situation was flipped and our land was being ruined mercilessly , we would obliterate them .
It all depends . The person is honestly .
They have their own word . Their own word 's the K word . The K word is super offensive and something . You just do n't say . You 're decent super offensive and something . It 's still not as serious as the N word .
I grew up in a quiet , suburban area with war . I grew up in a quiet , suburban area with all the pain . A quiet , suburban area was unfamiliar . All the pain comes alongside it .
Racism is something . This country does not like to talk about something .
I would have to agree that Jeffton did a very good job .
People from Afghanistan are violent because everything is war . War was related . We hear everything .
It is interesting . You brought it back to colonization .
We have this great opportunity . You can not go on campus a single day . Hearing someone is complaining about school .
They are regular individuals . Regular individuals have families . Regular individuals have jobs . Regular individuals have hopes . Regular individuals have dreams .
My first thought to why Americans might not understand the actual capabilities and qualities of other countries was directed toward our education system .
His openness to it makes the class so interactive . There is so many people in the class .
He was born in Afghanistan . He has to continue to live through conflict each day .
It was an opportunity . Not many people have . It was awesome to be a part of it .
I was a little taken . Sam asked about how black people can point out the shine to -LSB- Jeffrons -RSB- skin and white people cant .
No one should ever be scared to live in their own country whiles they have done nothing .
War seems to really dehumanize people .
I did find it inspiring when he felt that God had a reason that he survived the bombing and that he must keep on living for his son .
Our main mission is to eliminate terrorism wherever it may exist . Our main mission has been the main mission since 9/11 .
We all grow up differently . Every class want to be more empathetic towards people before I start making automatic assumptions based on their race , religion , culture , etc. . We have makes me Every class .
He 's one of the greatest people . I 've ever met the greatest people .
The war are a part of their lives . This is for people . People are living in Afghanistan . The war is the presence of other countries . The war is the danger around them .
I agree about the media falsely informing the public about how people in countries like Afghanistan actually live .
I would argue , because women are built differently , not because women athletes do not work as hard , their records fall short .
It may very well be the case . It is hard to tell .
Elementary school was tough . We learned the basics .
Conflict can look far away . Conflict can unrealistic at times . This is due to the fact . We do not live it every day .
Blindly doing what you think is right without considering how it might look is short-sighted .
I also have changed my perspective of them . I also have realized . They are similar to us .
I never really put myself . I never thought about how they felt .
These two bombs claimed multiple lives . These two bombs was a tragic , mournful day in our nations history .
Hearing about what life is like in a war zone has changed my perspective .
I grew up in a low income community all my life . Looking back the predominate sport has always been basketball .
It took insight .
Certainly I am idealistic . Media will always show some bias . It is a shame .
Afghans are made out to be individuals . Individuals are always in war . That is all . They know all .
Every time a civilian is hurt . It affects the lives of all others .
Most people seemed very unhappy to announce they did n't truly believe in our Country to pull through this incredibly difficult time . We are in this incredibly difficult time .
I can not fully understand it . I do believe it is there .
That isnt the response . Because Ive heard the same thing that he had . Afghan people were people of war .
This man is incredibly brave . I find myself questioning whether or not I would be able to do the same thing .
Here he was . Here he was speaking to us and safe from those threats .
I just do n't understand . That is all . We are exposed to all .
They are experiencing war . They are still generous and kind .
A future where all skin colors , religions and cultures are accepted as one .
We never really think about the little parts . The little parts make the whole of it up .
He talked about some small kids . About some small kids were killed . They were doing a good luck ritual . This was for the American soldiers . The American soldiers were involving incense .
He told us . This was a lot about what the lifestyle there is like . This was a lot about what the lifestyle there is the constant danger . He faces every day the constant danger .
I have taken living in country as safe as America for granted . I was hearing . Its like living in a war zone .
That is the major point . I got out the major point of this class .
I was n't even really sure where Afghanistan was until Sam showed us the image in class .
I am sad that my friends were treated that way .
There are many cultures . Have similar policies where they keep open doors and are more friendly to their neighbors many cultures .
They never thought . It was an issue in our household .
Just picturing a United States in which we walk around worried that well be shot in crossfire or have our houses or schools bombed at any given moment by a person who has never seen our faces or shook our hands scares me a lot . Its just a reality that millions of people are forced to live with .
The US does not talk about any branch of security . They do not want other countries .
This class session was really interesting and deep having people with first hand experience of the Afghanistan war in class to talk to us .
They were not only do harmful things . Also they are threatening those . Those are citizens of Afghanistan .
In the video on , What can the military do better ?
He made a great point . We attribute it . We are subjected to the news the things . We often hear about a country like Afghanistan .
We are sending people .
I was able to join the women in their dance .
This is a subject . A subject never usually crosses the minds of people . People are raised in America . We are so accustomed to the norm of racism . Most of us are unable to think outside of the box .
It makes . Me cringe to think that some place within driving distance of me could one day be turned into a war zone , just like in Afghanistan .
It showed me . He really does value us . He really care about how we feel in class .
We need to not jump to conclusions about people or groups of people so quickly .
The side the local people support is the side of whoever has control of their community at the time . Garey is Lieutenant .
People see this distorted image . They naturally Afghanistan to be that way this distorted image . Afghanistan is picture .
Those lives of young boys could have been spared . Young boys were burning the incense . It were for a simple understanding on the soldiers part .
Peace isnt achieved . Either side gets . They want and stop the fight .
Most people do n't get to experience what he got to experience so I appreciated him sharing it with all of us .
Yet it is . Rafi -LRB- and his now deceased partner -RRB- faced everyday . They did their work . Rafi was a reality .
I am not necessarily trying to prove a point . This observation is worth acknowledging and discussing . I 'm glad that lessonbrought it to everyone 's attention in class .
We need to just find a balance .
It 's more of a rundown of facts . We learn about war in history classes .
The fact that they cangracefully pick their lives back up and trek on with fulfilling responsibilities is astonishing and honestly quite inspiring .
This particular clip made . Me think about my own life .
I never understood . People had different colored skin before this class .
The worst of it all is . Many of these groups are the most vocal ones . Many of these groups make up a small proportion of the population .
The amazing part is . Rafi does not HAVE to put his life .
It is almost unimaginable to think about what life in a war zone would be like after having grown up in the United States .
I can never imagine . I would do . I lost everything suddenly .
Most of his job overseas was interacting with civilians . This was . Garey says . Garey was Lieutenant Colonel .
Was what did you learn in Afghanistan that shocked you the most .
I have been lucky enough to have never encountered war directly .
They are sad . It does not phase the attitude . It does not phase no matter . They contain to go throughout their everyday lives doing what they feel they were put on this Earth to do no matter .
I also grew up catholic . I also later on became a non denominational christian .
It is unimaginable to be in Rafis position .
He is aware his life is on the line . He keeps fighting the good fight .
The fact that Americas interest in oil in Iraq lead to so many deaths is unfathomable to me .
I thought . Raf was a very kind man . Raf was the way . About his family was adorable the way .
I find myself being completely guilty of that mindset . I absolutely need to change that .
There are elements of Afghan culture . Americans could learn from .
Because I feel like you also did that for me .
It is inhumane for Americans to not view these people .
There are to many stereotypes . Many stereotypes are associated with different cultures . Different cultures causes everything .
We is addressing race . We allow input for others . Input for others is ultimately resulting in more issues . Others may feel otherwise .
This is a really broad question .
Many people do n't understand . War affects people 's everyday lives .
They are very different from one another in regards to there occupation . She is an art teacher . He is a business man .
Clearly there are simple disconnects . The soldiers were misunderstanding . The children were running down with incense .
It was great to have Rafi come and talk . He opened my eyes . People in Afghanistan are real people .
I could not imagine living somewhere and then one day having my world turned upside down due to another countrys government .
