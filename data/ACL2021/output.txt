doing working with peace . partner was murdered . his family suffered a great loss .
the Islands . Most people travel to Europe . get a taste of the culture in those places .
I am sickened . my country has done to certain people .
It was enlightening said . he barely fired his weapon in Afghanistan .
People would 've been killed places would . there would have been much going on all at .
I do n't really agree too much about it having to do with body structure .
Both guests . us understand the . happening in Afghanistan .
I think the dialogue between soldiers Sam mentioned was a very beneficial idea .
to experience some . throughout his life in battle .
the wife is white with blonde . The husband is a black male .
Everyone has their own interpretation . that should be universally accepted .
these things how come people fight each other over religion .
I think you hit the nail on the head multiple times here .
I know . not a constant fight day in . I never really gave it much thought other than that .
Afghan civilians are not an abstract idea . civilians need to be recognized . people just like you .
do we think about it .
I agree with your thoughts on putting ourselves in the Afghan people 's shoes .
This helped me to connect the people in scenario to the United States .
we discuss race in this . Daniel I agree with several of your discuss . how we can really solve this issue .
Most of them are people similar to people in the United States . they are just trying to survive .
These people are just like us . we need to see that .
Two of my cousins enlisted . Two have served are serving multiple terms in Afghanistan .
that perfect word to describe . the story of the Lieutenants experience in Afghan .
I agree with everything you said .
many people . Wars affect . we are too caught up in our lives . whats going on in other . we to really realize going try . whats to help them .
In the video Sam shows a graph of the number of civilians killed over time .
They deserve to be thought of .
I may understand the politics . the necessities of continuing the war . no civilians want the war .
There are obviously a lot of things civilians do n't know about war . most have been in one .
said race plays a huge part in peoples lives .
we would . we would see the perspective of a minority .
the interactive aspect of technology has more pros to the class than .
someone who is from New York City . I know the feeling of coldness from a complete stranger .
Afghanistan has had conflict . they are a lot like us .
they could explain saw . I really found no defining characteristics .
thousands of men to fighting in this conflict . We have dedicated billions of dollars .
Families are losing loved ones . people like want peace are being threatened .
This lecture really made me think about things can we change the narrative .
I said in my last post race . Im a product of a mixed race couple . I am a mixed . mom is Korean . dad is white .
Wars new inventions . we are doing right . the things doing .
It was shaped from a cultural . timeline remembers all injustice .
Will we ever see peace come to fruition .
I ca n't help . my life would . life with war .
he was deployed in Afghanistan the kindness of the Afghan . deployed kindness really surprised him .
in the video Rafi was . about something more complicated .
He lost the people who he loved most in .
they invite you in to have a cup of tea .
Americans tend to be more inclined to play soccer .
The sad part is people . regular civilians are being hurt by the war the most .
War is injuring innocent people not necessary .

I wish . that is not realistic . such a large societal .
we are young . We are all taught this lesson young . us continue to fall into the same . view judgement be clouded by false propaganda .
Sam knew . It is interesting to me knew . of the Twitter feed .
how innocent these people are . people war should never be a solution .
I do believe there are necessity for war . needs to be battled with force .
they see about China was the China 30 years . we were going through a culture revolution .
seeing the graph of the number of civilians killed each year was scary .
First you mentioned how fortunate we are to live in America .
of our personal problems in this country are significantly . we think .
He tied it back to his religion . continuing to be angry about what happened is not going to change anything .
it to dilute the . people who are in reality not that different from us . we are over there bombing people .
A common ground of understanding . ground would help these issues to be . to truly see the real meanings behind . of tea .
we need to come together . I was always taught need . stop the race barriers .
tragedy like . tragedy is made personal . us to empathize with the Iraqi Afghan people . it makes it easier empathize .
My parents are Indian . understanding of Asian people . I just have more respect for understanding . lot of this . new information to me .
should we risk the lives of Americans .
a war was taking place in the country . I knew taking . images stories were revealed . it did feel real to revealed .
I personally think it will make civilians feel safer . what the soldiers are doing to protect them .
insight valuable to us .
it be from movies . I always thought of Afghanistan . just a big war zone in the desert .
I believe the controversy over dating outside a race is fading out . each new generation .
I can not . what he was feeling at moment . I can begin to imagine feeling .
I completely agree with what you are saying .
on the topic . It makes people uncomfortable sometimes topic .
They are being sent into war . with a purpose of benefitting other people . They defending other people .
some point this war has . families out of their hometown . Im war has chased . I believed . real families just like us . families live there . it is looked live .
people do not . you can not really relate .
It 's not fair that a culture can be viewed . a chance . chance prove . nobody really travels there .
something oriented towards learning . would actually be beneficial . facilitated by universities .
education to reach the poorer areas of our world i . we will all live in TRUE harmony .
here with half a suitcase full of . about Rafi coming . my dad did the same thing . talked that reminded me about did .
with civilians and security forces in Afghanistan . Garey took on a new perspective . a soldier in a foreign land .
we talked about race . the class talked . class interesting one .
all rise high above zero . He shows the graphical statistics of the military Afghanistan deaths rise .
you actively part of it .
This is a scary reality for me to think about . I have privileged . I always feel safe at home . my whole life by living in the United States feel . that one day a country will come in dropping bombs in my neighborhood . I fear come .
people have stereotypes about Chinese people . I know have . I do like math a lot .
Why would this man do does . would he put his life on the line .
I am . there are many Afghans are kind at heart like the soldier said .
I do n't think I would ever be able to .
all the lower end jobs seem to have people with a slightly darker skin .
It seemed like a pretty even mix of all races in every sport we had .
US is not helping other countries by bombing their cities hurting their civilians .
the people were against the Taliban .
he raised his hand . student raised . during the class . did make a very good point . people play sports based on availability .
Sam makes us remember . what happens across the seas .
Living in the US feeling . like a right .
people could not hear . village leader was able to talk to the soldier in an area hear .
it goes back to slave labor . black athletes of African . their bodies may have adapted to withstand harder working conditions .
The elder people in town would . to their home for a cup of tea . people would invite .
many Latinos soccer is the most popular sport . what country in Latin America .
the majority of his time was spent speaking with the locals . their culture . to know them .
My post discusses some of the same ideas . none take the . ourselves on what is going on in the world around us .
I take my safety granted . danger to my hometown . I have never experienced .
I instantly placed myself in the shoes of Lieutenant Colonel . I hoped a lot of people would care .
World state students facilitating dialogues between soldiers and civilians living in conflict zones is an amazing initiative .
Rafi came to speak with us . this war was going on around them constantly . people actually lived there .
I agree . people tend to . people never the good . people remember . the bad .
Why would he risk it .
They did not choose to be in the middle of destruction . it not them who are involved .
about race .
I loved . seeing his perspective on a couple different things .
I think this was a very good segment sparked . curiosity within the class . lot of .
Sam showed the number of civilian deaths is increasing .
his life is threatened every single day .
it is important to learn about other cultures . it can enhance our way of life .
right thing to . turban wearing gun holding angry extremist people .
racist to not want to . it is all about preference of what the person is looking .
Starting dialogue is definitely the simplest . way to bring about peace .
the media chooses to selectively show them .
This is not any individuals fault . just simple evidence shown by historical conflict .
an affirmative action is taken by someone of higher power to put an end to racism we will continue to suffer . I believe taken .
we Americans see past our own shores . It is imperative see . people understand their culture . of life .
It is what cements the bond between men in eternal brotherhood . other experience in life .
I think it is very easy to get caught up in the media . at the American heroic view of the war .
there are people . who were born into the . in Afghanistan . like Rafi are peaceful Afghanistan born . who have to continue to live through it .
I feel somewhat detached from what is happening there .
we a human race could remember those I . we would get a lot more done here on earth .
a sense . It allows insight on a country is thousands of miles away sense . makes a connection to us . our daily life .
their country will not always be known as one filled with war . these people have hopes known . It makes me sad to hear have .
time goes on people will date different . it will be accepted on a greater level .
The Afghan people have families they are providing for .
with people . the food . the hospitality . I now feel about judging a culture . way feel .
I originally was going to write about this topic . it hits very close to home .
I agree with your point Callie location definitely plays a role in the sports . things like culture play a role .
like this . Nothing has made an impact on me .
us to forget the obvious . Afghan people are people just like us .
I only would focus on the people were trying to do harm . I feel like this talk opened my .
land the home to many civilians rely on the resources in their area to live .
thing made me upset . we do not hear about the people who are trying to do good in . to help women .
Listening to Sam speak about the realness of war for citizens in Afghanistan . I have been looking at the full picture .
my grandparents had been three times . It had been a dream of mine to go . they said they would take me .
I can understand . I had previously .
Americans formed a hazy . the Afghan people . people live .
This man is definitely someone to look up to .
that not the first thing popped into my head made . me realize I need to be more open . there are loving courageous people all across the world .
bullets arent being fired in the next town over . They simply want their families friends to live in a country fired .
Sam introduced his friend Rafi . a family like people in the United States . that people have children . pictures of his children to demonstrate have . Sam showed .
I just grew up in a household . we did n't talk about race .
I ever imagined . imagined was a war zone .
turning the news you do n't see any of the average Afghan people being shown .
I always tried to push the topic of racism to the back of the room in my younger years .
powers threaten .
I think the media is a large contributing factor to this .
our home . away affecting we do not take it . him made me reevaluate . the way I think about war .
everyone has a type . everyone find your . willing open to try anything .
The troops were sent over there to fight . I did understand .
it is n't getting up on the television screen .
I think this really taught people not to judge a culture .
speaking about society 's wayward views on race is a step forward true acceptance of everyone 's races is a feat that may be near impossible .
This lecture showed me what a privilege it is to have that security .
It is sad to see how the number of innocent Afghan civilians killed . is rising year after year .
My image of the middle east has . that I have seen on the news .
The people who you are fighting are often . in the days of World War II .
He is trying his best to raise a family in a heat of . he himself is receiving death threats .
We should always have empathy towards people in .
I totally agree with everything you said .
she mentioned the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki . she asked us what we pictured mentioned .
there are civilians live like everyone else in these war zones . People forget are . the media start to paint a universal image . about the people of a certain nation at war .
The first thing people notice about me is the color of my skin .
I was living under . I would have living . that is going on around them . trying to continue on their everyday lives going .
Media factors have influenced us to not care about people themselves . a number .
In the end everyone has different features . they may be small . they hard to . they are there .
Rafi 's family really showed me how much Muslim 's are like us .
In almost every war we have fought innocent civilian people have been hurt .
I always thought more American soldiers were getting killed during the war . a significantly higher number of civilians in Afghanistan were killed than American soldiers .
they are different . that people in the US . specific reason .
real people . Afghanistan is a place .
I never had a personal reason to be invested in the subject .
The first thing is . I thought about . thing never took much time contemplating .
spreading the word to not . spreading first step .
he does n't do will . He said do .
I had no idea contact . the American troops were . most of these . in nature .
whites to talk about their opinion . this makes it hard talk .
black people have a better body structure to play basketball . was the first person to point out have .
They have families jobs and loved ones just like us .
it is . we cant understand their lives .
Taking the village leaders offer . offer shows a sign of good faith .
it comes to dating . People have different tastes comes .
race is not talked about to much . I agree with you talked .
Caroline I agree with your . you have mentioned .
We do not talk about racism enough in the right ways .
privilege alive .
You can not look at history . hasnt been around .
I had heard violent things about Iraq . him to go to Afghanistan during the war .
Children live in these conflict . Children go . to school play around with friends . experience a childhood .
A large part do understand . it like to go to war . them understand war . help understand .
Lieutenant Colonel . customs of the Afghan people . the elder was offering . offering a cup of tea . it was much more than that .
This idea leads me into my next point of understanding . we have a hard time connecting . we not in the same area . we can perceive . that the media dresses up for us .
people in Afghanistan . reason to improve their own . to help with certain matters .
people see other cultures . Media has the power to influence see . they can learn about them .
in perspective think acting . we would . this war was going on here . our lives were .
that does not mean serve . their nation resorts to violence .
In a crowd I often subconscious look at people . I different to . I very similar .
I have had a lot of experiences with different .
I am in agreement with . the end of the war . it is causing mass destruction .
Sam made . I agreed with mostly every point made .
I think you make a really good point .
Culture awareness lets the other side know . we are trying to make peace .
In the . I believe it is important to remember we are all humans with our own needs wants .
Americans tend to forget what war . it is just a thing . think thing .
The word generosity does not do justice to acts .
Sam really got me . us the life in Afghanistan .
Just to be happy throughout our life time . live up to our own .
this is an actual country just like ours . I do not think people understand country .
the war both sides of the troops need to consider . they can hurt really people . massively destructive weapons .
village elders coming . the soldiers into their homes . something really made me wonder .
I grew up in a very diverse community . I was always exposed to all different races .
The Afghanistan war began in 2001 . war has spanned the majority of my life .
far back to . is an amazing example . I did not think example .
It was very interesting to hear from everyday people . that think is supposed to be one of our enemies .
we do n't feel empathy .
there was a huge push including town halls to get people to .
many questions about their deployment at all .
he used his slides . people in Afghanistan . people are trying to get along with their daily . like anyone else .
Civilians who can not defend themselves from war .
It all was just .
these passionate . it people we need to make those final count .
someone looked different . them any less of a human .
it kills fifty percent of innocent civilians . It is different one someone tells you statistics about war kills . there are bombings every day .
I had thought about the civilians have to act sometimes survive . all they have .
all Afghans . Afghans think about war . to generalize think . We do not have the generalize . we do . we do know many Afghans .
What Drives You To Do What You Do .
I did . a soldier . Sam invited his friend to talk about his experience .
at first I would 've been seeking revenge . I would 've been able to accept first .
it be a large populated city . two mountains war takes place within the realms of people .
I could not imagine living in such terror .
of the longest . biggest internal . we can never fix .
War to an eighteen year old kid has never considered enlisting in the military at . such a foreign concept in a .
It not in this particular video . the Afghan people . we at war with the country of Afghanistan .
He could very easily keep quiet . could you blame him .
word Afghanistan comes to mind I think about poverty death . these places have real people else . guilty of forgetting have . no part in the war .
this is something people forget .
She is . us start a dialogue in education .
These are usually people that just want better for their country . they are brought in into the war .
It interesting to view issues . during the lecture with Bassim .
Today I do n't think most people would think of vacationing in Afghanistan .
race is beautiful . what you said beautiful . I totally agree said .
one in my family . one family has joined the army navy marines .
Adam you bring up an interesting addressing . Afghan people who were emotionally damaged . their hearts . much hate anticipate .
Personally I am very open to being with someone from another race .
We are . We lucky to live in such . we often forget the struggles of other people .
I did . I felt did .
This connected me to the people of a war area . it reminded me to think about the cultural differences .
It is such a selfless way of viewing the situation .
achieving this is not easy feat .
war affects civilians in their own countries . I had little knowledge affects .
about in my discussion group . is it to inform us .
We are the great heroes of the world is always ready to save the day .
My dad had the same experience with Afghan people . they were always .
self hear stories . we experience stories . we can not truly understand what exactly is happening somewhere else .
this perspective . we are using in the region .
does not . modernized does make a civilization happy . It goes to show make .
to see what they saw . I think it would take me a see . millions of people of different races . I met . became friends with .
I 'm sure most of us would n't feel comfortable having tea with a stranger in a village . that 's kind of upsetting . it the culture is too welcoming .
assuming we ever fully understand a culture is dangerous . can lead to more problems .
to assume things . about people only . a generalization .
All is greater than his fear of the daily death . he is inspirational .
he mentioned . towards the end of the video .
I know a lot of mixed race couples . they are wonderful .
a different outlook on life .
military are the ones fighting .
It makes it easier to cope with much death .
Is it even more arrogant . most of the problems are occurring in said country .
This the topic comes . up in . all of a certain group act the same way . we tend to generalize act .
missing Afghanistan . thinking a man was going to put something in his tea missing . going the transition .
It is interesting to learn about what their life is like .
I agree with everything you said .
This is not the first time this has happened .
We all need to see beyond the media people in countries like Afghanistan are living their lives like normal people in US .
most somehow disconnect from . the real world is like .
do we get the privilege of living . the war has . war has began .
we are fighting a war .
I hope one day people will all . the people there are n't different than the people here .
the Colonel told us that the Afghani hospitality was welcoming .
we do need to make the topic more open to help educate society . that will start getting rid of racism .
were there possible spies out listening to . that apart of his culture .
In our own little ways . we can find ways to support people whose lives have been affected by wars .
People do not understand . life is supposed . race does . does define us .
He was there in the first place to find . who in the Taliban have .
Every year the numbers get higher . which is scary for the people living in that country .
we need to embrace .
It is likely this could never be fully traced . it is an interesting thought to juggle .
bad thing is happening . that only half of the story .
it originated . people lived in the North originated . Sam said lived . hockey is a Northern sport . that is culture . he is right culture location .
I chose the video clip Are Sports Inherently Racist .
I think it has to do a lot with you live .
it is suffering from . It says a lot more about a culture suffering .
you mentioned Jordan everyone should look to this man . everyone realize how much love dedication . this man puts forth every single day . we all can learn something very positive from Rafi .
our soldiers . soldiers inhabit every once . They are not an abstract concept live in inhabit .
It is both unfortunate . I was not the only one who was ignorant incorrect about what war zones were . zones like .
his meeting with an Afghan civilian .
there to be no war . Is it even possible war .
they are you can not change them .
forces looming over the citizens . difference was the threat of the Taliban looming .
those stereotypes exist . a shame exist .
I do n't think my parents ever saw . needed to be discussed with me .
This really allowed us to know what living there is like .
Sam is opening up the eyes of many students . it makes me wonder where this ignorance stems from .
I enjoyed hearing about the average Afghanistan citizen . throughout my life . I have continued to hear skewed . I feel continued .
It is . they being affected by war .
we learn . It is hard to resist learn . we know have been filtered .
Who will help bring peace to his country . he did n't try to do something to stop the violence . to his .
people into . aspect this interpretation of what war is is the education we are raised up on .
Families forged from fire tend to have the tendency to have stronger . closer relationship .
You need to see all sides not just one .
the enemy . hard to explain to someone your excitement to go out on patrol to search close .
A better understanding of culture allows for a more worldly perspective reduces . any sort of fear .
Many war zones were civilian homes first . meant they are . to be .
we should stop . that is far from what they are .
people may think of Afghanistan of a place of terror . think there are normal civilians live . that is where their families are from .
I do agree with you with our class being awesome . class accepting of comes . I do hope more people got comfortable with this discussion topic . to volunteering for class .
issues along the way . we believe in causing turmoil . We stand up believe .
some do not even see the battle field on deployment .
It may not be the safest place to visit .
They would not have been thrilled at the people coming into their land . there would have been some amicable agreement .
I feel like it is time . we see something other than people with guns .
War is a terrible thing . from an .
Im always scared to bring up some sort of touchy . a question . something they do not want to think about .
Speaking to Bassim opened my eyes . Speaking broke my heart .
did he do to deserve to live in .
I did n't realize these middle east countries had nice homes . the middle class .
It 's not everyday you get to talk to people have experienced the culture . a citizen of Afghanistan .
It was nice to see his views of the country change . he spent time there .
I appreciate your post in giving . a full . there is a miscommunication with the way people perceive Afghanistan .
to school a job a sport . comes it comes down to my race .
We see it pop up in the news more . it has lead to the formation of anti hate groups . black lives matter .
Rafi was raising his daughters . Sam mentioned raising . they were growing up in a war zone .
I never truly new soldiers may come out of the experience . a connection with this opposing nation .
their definitions they do n't really carry the weight of means . what to suffer .
I do n't think it is eye opening . a white person . how hard it is in every aspect . is for an African American .
The media . involvement began in Afghanistan .
We are taught growing up . cities battle .
Lieutenant Colonel Rich Gary in person was very impressive in . he talked freely about his time . experience in Afghanistan .
I do not see this issue ever subsiding .
the snarky comments Sam . there was a con .
This love may not be big enough to end wars at first . it could stop bullies .
not living in that effects area can make you feel very disconnected .
Sam showed us the pictures of the city . some of the people who live in Afghanistan are not . people different than me .
There were children were killed families lost everything . people getting killed .
In this society we all have ingrained insecurities . most would change something about ourselves . she is proud .
listen to realize . it is important to learn . people in Afghanistan are real people .
this war . There are a innocent people are getting harmed . they are just trying to live their lives like myself .
Many families were killed . families left for dead .
I thought civilians would be okay . they not part of the war . people are being affected by this war .
It is mind blowing .
an average citizen spend their day . an attack could bring .
it is easy to . progress can be made with many countries involved .
We see it on the news everyday about racial inequality . Americans will . the world has ever seen . they of the biggest villains seen .
In the United States we are fortunate enough . any war fought on .
My graduating high school class had 130 students . one Asian . there was only one black person Asian . I can remember out of all of us .
is war a continuing thing .
what a modern Afghanistan looked like . I did know looked .
that was my hometown where my parents were living in .
empathy words are words and situations are situations .
story definitely sheds . of the United States foreign policy of drone strikes in the Middle East .
the American policy caused him massive loss . a perspective caused . he does n't think that our country has the capacity to change .
Dr. Richards . the war in Afghanistan .
I specifically want to talk about the war in . it the longest conflict in U.S history .
I never seemed to . part about war .
hardly any clothes . they have this warm spirit . they happy .
racism will continue to exist 100 years from now .
we are disconnected . it is easy to get a warped view of what is happening in other parts of the world . the news shows us .
I mean I have heard about it . who is fighting who .
I think it was good how speaking . about his first thoughts on Afghanistan .
My prayers go out to rafi . his family . everyone living in a war zone .
I agree . Rafi wants it . like people in the US want freedom .
This lecture was very eye opening for . broadening my view on the current war . I look forward broadening .
They may not have . they willing to give .
I am from Ethiopia . I came here just like most African Americans I have faced certain things . that comes with the history of the country . I am black .
I had never thought about the implications of war . it local .
I again put myself in his daughters shoes . saying goodbye to my father every morning . it was my last time seeing him .
war can beneficial in . I would say beneficial . it war is not good .
is somebody going to take the courage . to implement actions to solve this .
My view on war . view just a representation of the . to have . Ive been raised . of worry about my home land .
Mushroom cloud . cloud houses buildings torn apart were common responses .
I knew . a country has been a battlefield for a long time .
This lecture opened up my mind to sympathize . majority of people in Afghanistan . they are innocent . people there are evil .
My teachers mentioned it to us . I would see it in the news .
Real people are being affected here .
This most definitely opened up my eyes . privileged we truly are .
those people lead us to not giving . them a chance to be learned about . a nation .
Afghanistan is a country of almost 35 million people is a large number . that is not true country . there is no way . that all of those people are bad .
Soldiers had been served in Afghan would have developed a special bond to Afghan .
is always . the world . arguing world is going to get worse .
It is 2017 . things have not changed .
My oldest cousin . a war can .
Rafi is a prime . all Afghans are in . the war in general .
Categorizing people makes things simpler . it can be unfair .
my mind drifts towards the negative ideas . the home to awful people target attack the US .
I know I am very quick to judge to an . I need to work on that .
Raf wife have communicated their situation . I wonder communicated . beautiful girls .
this hit me kind of hard .
the lieutenant . shattered my previous .
We need to remove all preconceived notions are brought about through stereotypes . misinformation from the media .
me to the people in war . story the story . he would share information with him .
our country was founded on . we think the way we do today .
This video really opened my eyes up to these concepts . me a different side of war .
they did not mean every man .
is one of the most powerful . in class .
in reality they just want to live normal lives like we do . they are people filled of hatred want . They do n't deserve for people to look at them think people .
Talked about Martin Luther King . he changed the lives of many people . others can be different than ourselves .
growing up in the United States . army tends to be always be fighting over . never a war in our homeland .
heard man invited him into his home for tea was amazing . Lieutenant Garey share his story accepting invited .
They are poor . They do not live normal lives .
I found this point in class interesting . with you .
They have jobs trying to make away just like we are .
This question has been overlooked long .
It was surprising to hear . doing his job . Raf is living doing . about the constant threat living .
Educate someone to respect someone . there would be no problem with differences .
speech therapists to understand provide . we do know something about their culture .
superpowers the world are at war . you one person . a hopeless .
Afghanistan I automatically think of war . images of my parents .
It interesting to . Christians do n't agree with .
In your post you raised a lot of good points involving race in our culture .
I think is more important is . we can never imagine the influence in between the people .
heard plenty of stories of Afghani families . that would invite service members into their homes . a large .
the current war in afghanistan . life he has been threatened .
Ive never said goodbye to my parents in the morning .
He did not do anything wrong . his family was murdered .
we fail to learn from it .
This is n't true . the positive aspects of the country used . war broke out .
people know the number of civilians in Afghanistan being killed . is increasing is . there nothing happening to help decrease those numbers .
that the military person in him always trying to be aware . I would have done the same .
119 class . The conversation between Basim .
Going said . I find myself . why people do n't just get up . myself wondering get leave .
I completely agree with you . much in America . I do believe we talk about race .
more black people participate in basketball . It certainly is visible participate . white people lean towards hockey .
The other thing is at my school there were basic sports . we do n't have hockey lacrosse swimming .
in the . to the ongoing war . are being affect by this war .
Two very good reasons . ended up . ended completely false .
We can not forget it .
It is affecting the innocent citizens of Afghanistan . that is rarely thought comes . the decisions of the .
They are happy . the life they know .
I never . war does affect real people .
soldier like .
Learning about the country you are going to occupy . the US military .
thing I wish would have been mentioned in this discussion by Sam was our Penn State reads book .
The media is . images videos of war torn destitute shots .
the class . we have . white people tend to be the most uncomfortable . comes I 've noticed can be very true . to race noticed .
These movies display a Hollywood version of the Middle East is very different from it is really like .
In the video I selected . that shocked you the most . Garey was asked the question What thing did you learn shocked .
The first thing should be established . we are all humans . we should be treated .
he was fighting . in the .
he continues to lead a normal life . he I saw seemed to feel content with the way his life is now .
We can try our best to minimize . our progress .
People all over the world may be going through tough situations issues .
I agree with you . the educational system is very Eurocentric .
You are hard pressed to find interviews with the actual grunts shows you what it is like .
We seem to be taught . all Afghan people are violently vicious .
These children are brought up learning their cultures values . are often very different from American cultural values .
soldier was about intelligence training . soldier teaming up with the . I knew training teaming . that actually was . no idea was .
to the general public . the news would have shown events like . Afghanistan would not have such a negative war connotation .
it took for independence . a few protests .
I go to Argentina to visit my family . it is predominantly white . I use to . wasnt an issue .
The men of the town were gathering to discuss the importance of voting .
Rafi mentioned he can not just wait around . he let other people take action .
about the hospitality of Afghan people . me to try to be a better person in way . Learning encourages .
the elder . in the long run they are the ones do . elder his family would be supporting the group had the most power ones . It make complete sense supporting . should the elder go against .
I like the part of your response say . The war . values up . war may eat such cultures .
fact makes . I think the makes . we do not completely know the other culture . it more interesting to share .
said the Middle East is portrayed far differently in the media .
the bible is Gods . we should conduct our lives .
the internet in modern . infinite access . believe should much more accountability educating .
Civilians want . they to are affected by this war greatly .
They should have the same experience we had in class with the two guests spoke .
the soldiers interpreted it as poison gas . put out the gas . soldiers made the decision to kill the kids .
They have the same dreams . They to school getting a job . a family one .
you said about media knowing wanting . they know everything is really important .
You always see the people with the big guns walking around looking very intimidating .
mentioned he was a lawyer in this country trying to create laws . laws regulations decrease the violence in Afghanistan .
citizens were at the wrong . citizens place at the . Boy was dropped . their day . day started .
I have never experienced a college class . media has been advocated to this .
Afghan people are to the american soldiers .
I agree with you in feeling outrage at the U.S response to Bassim 's loss .
It is hard to imagine it as a prospering place . families who have the same dreams . we do . we are . we are exposed . to is images of poor children and war .
war wont affect innocent civilians . can we do to ensure affect .
here at Penn State . opportunity to enrich ourselves with more knowledge about the world we live in .
Bassim has . the result of war .
war has been fought on foreign soil .
it impossible to . he does deserve .
I understand your feelings understanding . the citizens of Afghanistan have to face on a regular basis .
I do chalk a lot of the issue up to ignorance .
own fascinating cultures . I think every nation has .
bloodshed on our own land . We do n't have battles . to other people .
I cant imagine having to constantly worry about whats going to happen . much a war zone .
How could you be expected to forgive a country bombed your home your dog your family .
I grew up in an extremely safe . close knit community where walking around .
I am guilty of thinking .
this video the people . people events of Afghanistan became more real .
people recognize . I believe there is more to the job of a soldier recognize .
a discussion on current events . I know from personal experience one of my history teachers in high school made it a point of emphasis to open up .
He does responsibility .
Learning about other cultures intrigues . tough to . you can talk to someone from that culture .
Raf great guest . All I definitely agree guest .
war was switched . switched occurring we would want it to end . the ideology of a select .
he is a hero war was a traumatic experience .
had a shocking impact on me .
he went through list I was trying to put myself in his daughters shoes .
us Afghanistan broken up into different districts . the districts are split up kind of like our own states .
Afghanistan has bustling cities with crowded streets . cities malls just like American cities do .
We always tend to look down at places like Afghanistan . Americans should learn from them . there are a few things learn .
I went to a Model United Nation Conference in Washington D.C. talking about South China Sea . other American students .
The Tea Story was extremely impactful .
He needs to be able to spread his experiences to both civilians .
what it would feel like to wake up every . vast majority of us here at Penn State have absolutely not idea feel . you would live to see the . wondering live have . spend with your loved ones .
He mentioned numerous times . the great people of Afghanistan are seeking peace .
trying to imagine they go through daily is impossible .
I could imagine . what is being done to them is something no one should ever have to deal with . in those .
From an outsiders ' perspective . would n't . would that seem a little extreme .
I agree with you said . US does talk about any branch of security openly with other countries .
would be spend a day in the shoes of culture . I have always wondered spend .
every country deals . the end . there are positive sides to the story .
The constant remembrance of these hard times can lead us to be more fearful . to worse situations .
he today to talk about his experience . in the past .
a lot of this can be . way media . what is actually going on in the world .
They have to appease those in control to stay alive .
All it takes is awareness .
Sam calls out to the white people to make . I can admit I fail all of the identification games we play calls . I 100 % his audience .
I wish I had enough courage to do what this man is doing in to help others .
What can I do .
how much do we care .
I do not watch a lot of news . I do not keep up with a lot of current events in our world . like this side of the story is never . is spoken about . why I had never put the thought into it .
me to make connections to my own traditions . I than I ever imagined . family values . the people of Afghanistan .
I do not agree with treating people like lab rats .
Most of this racial tension in . in certain groups feeling . theyll offend another group .
This particular story . the culture of a nation .
I am a white male . I have sometimes turned the blind on an issue male . I not sure what to . I will offend . I make things worse .
Rafi was talking to us about his life . it hit me .
the media is the major influence on most people from different countries around the world .
I think we need to do a better job at paying . educated about what is going on in the world around us .
one of the many blessings of being born into the right nation .
we are over 25 years . we are seeing more of these headlines in the news .
Rafi was receiving death threats . he would stay in that situation .
in American culture . questions in class is . a good thing .
Sitting through this lecture has taught me . Sitting has changed my perspective on war . what is happening .
is it . us to see that . it hard see .
I love about this class . it allows us the opportunity to talk about issues topics may be taboo difficult .
I thought this class interesting . like the . people forget . is going on .
That the side of warfare gets . people should be told those types of stories .
the war from a different point . citizens of Afghanistan must . my perception of war .
understanding the culture they are working with . I think the example of India is one of the best examples of the military understanding .
the Lieutenant Colonel . Colonel told . The story told . story is a very powerful example of .
He holds a job has friends . He lives his life .
do we talk about race .
goal is universal . goal is applicable to what people want in the .
Not everyone who lives there is violent .
He could walk away from . people continue to try to take care of it .
Terrorist groups do not need fighting soldiers to be their targets .
He always were jerseys to school . he loved the Celtics .
from listening .
All I did really enjoy how I was able to dive into the current news in high school . everyone can do a better job to . of war .
I thought Ahmad Rafi did a wonderful job . into the mind of an Afghan citizen .
It is almost hard not to be mad at myself closed . Afghan people are completely different from . I gained a little bit more insight about Afghan people from this .
I read news articles every . U.S. is doing in the Middle East . read I do have a clear picture doing .
a minimal amount of the class could be used for current events . I did appreciate how he would talk about modern news every class .
He is talking . like a dream a long term goal . goal might never be achieved in his life time .
In my opinion there are two sides to take .
soldiers on a battlefield shooting one . I always picture war shooting .
I can think of this question in different scales . that will totally lead to different answers .
I have had many thoughts ideas . pictures of Afghanistan .
This story highlights the utmost importance of learning the culture of a country .
Race is important to understand . what it is today .
This man is inspiring .
this topic discussed . I encountered .
to sports spreading . one day teams will look more diverse spreading .
The superpowers of the world want them to keep fighting .
I am not a expert in noses . I feel slowing down . looking would have definitely helped him to be more accurate .
we create some false picture of . what we would . we would think .
I would not thought about learning about . They have a great culture thought . this class . we were introduced to .
It has made me aware of the cultural . exchange a result of this .
no concept of another culture . you might be . interacting with someone from that culture for the first time .
did I first start thinking about the impact of war on civilians .
Teachers to focus on these . our American soldiers .
My mom is no longer in the military . my dad is active duty . both have been deployed to Afghanistan .
led coalition has been responsible . the deaths of . that can not be ignored . was evident from the presentation .
talking about race . To me there is no such thing talking .
I feel like everyone should be educated on what is going on .
he finds justice . My only wish is finds . it would ever make up for what he 's lost .
coverage of Afghanistan on the news . what made out a bad image . in America .
the word Afghanistan the picture would automatically come in my mind . picture similar to what Garey says in this video .
They might gave reasons . an excuse just to go invade another country .
situation was flipped . that would never happen in the United States flipped .
Sam brought speakers from Afghanistan . sure what to expect .
The hardest thing to face about both of these books . what Sam based this video off of interpretation .
I thought one . the class on September 12th .
It really makes you think . trivial our daily issues are compared to what people in other parts of the world are going through .
it is . the media will not show . we take our own initiative to learn show .
the part featured in the video . others reacted to this lecture . at their .
The war has caused American troops to loose their lives . families have been left in the dark .
of the Islamic faith . a religion .
children should grow up learning the war from another perspective .
It by seeing the Afghan people . we will limit the amount of casualties . that will prolong the conflict .
the culture in Afghanistan . his objective in . the Taliban men were in the town .
can even . they assist our own soldiers .
White privilege is a thing statistics back it up . the answer to everything .
He said social work economy destroyed . that was difficult to listen to . normal life are .
They are the ones minding their own . nothing to worry about .
the we are . we are being given half of the story .
much into . I never looked .
he stops fighting . stops who will continue .
I found this portion of lecture to be interesting .
someone is different naturally puts people on edge . The idea different .
This was the first time I . exposed to the radical images of afghan people . I was in . into the social norm of stereotyping .
In modern media other civilizations are generally shown in a way that implies certain meanings about them .
Things are not . they seem .
I always . they are . our features are the way are .
To be . honest I understood the Iraq war .
different people . this it is really hard for me to understand the amount of death was put into this war .
trying to live their everyday lives . Innocent people are dying trying .
me think more about religion . it might be interesting to . the Bible . a better understanding of tell . the books . daily lives .
I can tell myself . our own sake . were doing everything .
the photo of Basim 's house after the bombing . bombing made . much more real to me .
the good people in the USA . good people in . we wish those awful people amongst . ruining the beauty of differences .
these perspectives . a personal . majority of civilians . start it will be hard . war like . it to understand what like .
He changed my opinion of the Afghan people . him speak for a short period of time .
times I feel . myself associate regular . living in the Middle East . people living . a strong political position with the party is native to their country .
I guess at the time I really did not have much choice to choose from talking race wise .
time break down these differences in people based . are from . they really made me think differently about the topic of race .
that happening in Afghanistan .
it is the opposite .
hearing people speak about war . seeing the real people . we gain a sense of understanding had . people families afflicted gain .
their morals . The people wanted to teach . a better . they a country .
said the vast majority of people in power are white .
does want to . someone will resist the temptation to be distracted by their technology . what the student who DOES want to . student gets from the class . someone will take away gets .
Race can have hundreds of meanings is talking .
Real people being affected by war .
Bassim is truly a great individual . I appreciate him . Sam coming together to . him speak to us .
I thought it was cool that their culture is about giving . most have . I think we can really learn from the people of Afghanistan in .
The Lieutenant never mentioned the word generosity . at the end of his speech Sam did .
We live in the country . We have soccer cross country basketball baseball softball track .
Sam started telling the story of Basim . Sam showed the pictures of his house . showed it really put things in perspective .
Young innocent blacks have been victim to racism by the police for several years now .
Basim is able to forgive . It is amazing able . leads to my thought . it is very important for the people who do not understand the Islamic faith to become more educated .
were white talked basketball all day every day . his best .
Afghanistan in the recent decade has faced war .
people of a country at war are not always thought about . I think the citizens .
they were being treated like africans americans . the white person is just imagining treated .
he had his own . of these people .
this discussion about the civilians in Afghanistan . it is a topic . that has crossed my mind .
His home was completely demolished . pieces of concrete everywhere .
Sam bluntly points out same . It 's really refreshing points . we are all the . our distinctive racial features .
I could n't agree more society is very open to interracial relationships .
This simmering discontent under the British . what led to the Revolt . Indian men . men led a nationwide revolution to eject the invaders out of India . in the British army .
this is likely . I agree likely . due to a lack of exposure to diversity .
50 Afghanis were killed in a suicide bombing at a wedding . we cant imagine the impact of that .
I agree with your thoughts on little we discuss Afghanistan outside of the war .
I never paused to consider the Afghan people whose homes were being invaded .
My high school was pretty diverse . interracial dating .
Some people feel . no return with the state we are in . we have reached a point .
we take some initiative of our own to go .
Education would allow individuals to walk in someone .
They live such different lives . they do have such different culture .
end a war . We have no power to start prevent end .
It is so upsetting to think . many children . children families fear . their lives . to the grocery store .
I found his strength . strength humility to be incredible .
Afghanistan is a real place with real people . have normal lives like any other country in the world . war people are living . what is going to happen next .
he goes to work knowing . Rafi said his wife says goodbye to him everyday goes . his family . there will be an explosion could hurt him .
American are being . not the war . I feel like it is time for us to inform show the people of this place war .
I had to send my biracial daughter to school I would never . I went through . her to go went .
This man has such strong . his work . he is doing for his family . he believes doing .
The same exact thing happened to Bassim has probably happened to many other families in Afghanistan . one here in America talks about that .
the problem on white . they have it .
the war . more of a negative . I was wrong .
I always thought that war was about the United States constantly fighting . shooting the enemy in .
we live in a world . It saddens me live .
Jordan I feel the same exact way . incredible bravery he puts forth every single day of his life .
about the bombing . a local shopping center near me . center be destroyed by a foreign military .
problems with race in out country . There is obviously problems . matter the color . you are you see it in everyday life .
about a . to the problem .
help us survive in a certain climate . In reality we all have the features help .
Growing up I always read about war .
Cooperation dialogue is not one sided . assuming especially in a war zone is a leap of faith at times . the other side is welcoming .
They bounce . awesome to be around . of each .
everyone has their own views . over in Afghanistan .
He talks about his wife saying goodbye every . it a bomb .
It is absolutely unfair to the civilians . land was being ruined mercilessly . flipped ruined we would obliterate them .
the person is honestly .
They have their own word word . 's the . which is super offensive .
I grew up in a quiet suburban area unfamiliar with . pain comes alongside it .
Racism is something this country does not like to talk about .
I would . Jeffton did a very good job . to agree did .
people from Afghanistan are violent . I assume violent . everything we hear on the news about . is war related .
you brought it back to colonization . It is interesting brought .
we have this great opportunity . you can . have you can go on campus hearing . complaining about school .
They are regular individuals have families jobs .
Americans might . Americans might understand the actual capabilities . My first thought understand . qualities of other countries was directed toward our education system .
His openness to it makes the class . many people in the class .
He was born in Afghanistan . He has to continue to live through conflict each day .
It was an . not many people have . it was awesome to be a part of it .
I was a little taken aback . black people can point out the shine to . white people .
No one should ever be scared to live in their . they have done nothing .
War to really dehumanize people .
I did find it inspiring . he must keep on living for his son .
mission has the main mission . mission is eliminate terrorism exist .
We all grow up . we have makes me want to be more empathetic start . based on their race religion .
He 's one of the greatest people I 've ever met .
in Afghanistan the war the . war presence danger are a part of their lives .
I agree about the media falsely . the public about . people in countries like Afghanistan actually live .
I would . women are built differently . women athletes do not . their records on average fall .
it is hard to tell .
Elementary school was . we learned the basics .
conflict can look far away . I agree look unrealistic . we do not live it every day .
it might look is short sighted . what you think is right look .
I have changed my perspective of . they are similar to us .
I never really put myself in someone else 's shoes . they felt .
two bombs claimed multiple lives . was a tragic mournful day in our nations history .
life is like in a war zone has changed my perspective on my own life .
I grew up in a low income community . all my life . back the predominate sport has always been basketball .
It took insight from a native to help give him the directions of how to approach the elder by talking . over tea .
I am idealistic media will always show . it is a shame . in their presentation of other peoples .
Afghans are made out to be individuals who are always in war . that all they know .
a civilian . it affects the lives of all others .
they did believe in our Country to pull through this incredibly difficult . Most people seemed very unhappy to announce believe . we are in .
I can not fully understand . is there .
I really expected from the Lieutenant heard . Afghan people were people of war . he had people .
I find myself . I think this man is incredibly brave find . myself questioning . I would be able to do the same thing .
he was in America speaking to us . he safe from those threats .
I do n't understand why that all we are exposed to .
they are experiencing war they .
A future . all skin colors religions . colors religions cultures are accepted .
We never really think about the little parts make the whole of it up .
He talked about some small kids killed . a good luck . American soldiers involving incense .
us a . constant danger he faces every day . the lifestyle .
like living in a war zone . living in country safe granted .
That is the major point . I got out of this class .
us the image in class .
my friends were treated . I am sad treated .
There are many cultures have similar policies . they keep open doors . they are more friendly to their neighbors .
They never thought it was an issue in our household .
be shot in crossfire . picturing a United States in we walk around worried shot have . by a person has never seen shook . a reality millions of people are forced to live with .
I feel the US does not talk about any branch of security openly . they operate . they do want other countries to know operate .
session was really interesting . experience of the Afghanistan war in class to talk to us .
do harmful .
In the video on What can the military do better .
He made a great . a country like . we are subjected to the news .
we are sending people into war . no concern .
I was able to join the women in their dance .
This is a subject that never usually crosses the minds of people are raised in . to the norm of racism . most unable to think outside of the box .
It makes me cringe to . some place within driving distance of . place could one day be turned into a war zone just like in Afghanistan .
he does value us . It showed me value . we feel in class .
groups of people . we need to not jump to conclusions about people . I agree need .
the side the local people . is the side . people support . This person tells Lieutenant Garey support . has control of their community at the time .
Afghanistan to be . Afghanistan way . people see this distorted image they naturally picture .
Those lives of young boys were burning the incense protect . the soldiers . on the soldiers part .
side stop the fight .
I appreciated him sharing it with all of us . Most people do n't get to experience what he got to experience appreciated .
it is a reality Rafi . his now deceased partner faced everyday . faced they did their .
I am not necessarily trying to prove a point with this response . this observation is . observation worth . trying I feel worth . it to everyone 's attention in class .
We need to just find a balance .
we learn about war in history classes . learn it 's more of a rundown of facts .
they pick their lives back up . on with . fact is astonishing . quite inspiring .
me this particular clip made me think about my own life .
I never understood why people had different colored skin . this class .
The worst of . many of these groups are the most vocal ones . groups make up a small proportion of the population .
The amazing part is HAVE . Rafi to put his life on the line .
It is almost unimaginable to think about . life in a war zone . would having grown up in the United States .
I lost everything .
Lieutenant Colonel Garey says most of his job overseas was interacting with civilians .
that shocked you the most . did you learn in Afghanistan shocked . question asked was learn .
I have been lucky . have encountered war .
they are sad it does not phase the attitude . what they contain to go throughout their everyday lives . what they feel they were put on this Earth to do .
I grew up catholic . on became a non denominational christian .
It is unimaginable to be in position .
He is aware his life is on the line . he keeps fighting the good fight .
fact Americas interest in oil in Iraq lead to many deaths is unfathomable to me .
I thought man way . about his .
I find myself being completely guilty . I absolutely need to change that .
Americans could learn from . there are elements of Afghan culture learn .
I am responding to your post .
Americans to not view these people with value . It is inhumane view .
There are to many stereotypes that are associated with different cultures .
By addressing race we allow input for others who may feel otherwise ultimately resulting in more issues .
I think this is a really broad question .
Many people do n't understand how war affects people 's everyday lives .
They are very different from . he man .
there are simple disconnects . the children were running down with incense . misunderstanding running .
he opened my eyes to the . It was great to have Rafi come talk opened . people in Afghanistan are real people .
I could not imagine living somewhere . having my world turned upside down due to another government .
