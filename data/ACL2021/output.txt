and his family suffered a great loss . partner was murdered for doing working with peace suffered .
Most people travel to Europe or the Islands and get a taste of the culture in those places .
I am sickened by different things that my country has done to certain people .
It also was enlightening too how Colonel said . that he barely fired his weapon in Afghanistan .
People would 've been killed places would have been bombed and there would have been so much going on all at once .
I do n't really agree too much about it having to do with body structure .
Both guests helped us understand the condition happening in Afghanistan .
I think the dialogue between soldiers civilians that Sam mentioned was a very beneficial idea .
As he did have to experience some form of conflict throughout his life in battle . have it was very minimal .
fair skin . the wife is white with blonde hair . The husband is a black male .
Everyone has their own interpretation but there are somethings that should be universally accepted .
If religion is saying these things how come people fight each other over religion .
I think you hit the nail on the head multiple times here .
but I never really gave it much thought other than that . I know that its not a constant fight day in gave .
and me . I agree that Afghan civilians are not an abstract idea and need to be recognized as people just like you me .
And how much do we think about it .
I completely agree with your thoughts on putting ourselves in the Afghan people 's shoes .
This helped me to connect the people in that scenario to the United States .
Daniel I . but I 'm not sure how we can really solve this issue . Daniel I agree with several of your opinions on how we discuss race in this country sure .
and they are just trying to survive . Most of them are people similar to people in the United States trying .
These people are just like us and we need to see that .
Two of my cousins enlisted . have served are serving multiple terms in Afghanistan .
I think that that is a perfect word to describe Afghan civilians after hearing the story of the Lieutenants experience in Afghan .
I agree with everything that you said .
many people and we are too caught up in our lives to really realize whats going on in other countries and try to help them or at least support them . Wars affect so people .
In the video Sam shows a graph of the number of civilians killed over time .
They deserve to be thought of and helped .
but I know that no civilians want the war . I may not understand the politics and the necessities of continuing the know .
most have never been in one . There are obviously a lot of things that civilians do n't know about war one .
said race plays a huge part in peoples lives .
Most of the time we would only see the perspective of a minority .
I feel that the interactive aspect of technology has more pros to the class than cons .
As someone who is from New York City I know the feeling of coldness from a complete stranger all too well .
Afghanistan has had conflict but they are a lot like us .
However I do wish they could explain what they saw because I really found no defining characteristics .
We have dedicated billions of dollars and thousands of men to fighting in this conflict .
Families are . Families are losing loved ones and people like Rafi who want peace are being threatened .
This lecture really made me think about things can we change the narrative .
my dad is white so Im a product of a mixed race couple . I said in my last post that I am a mixed race because my mom is Korean and white .
Wars new . all the things that we are doing right now just seem so useless .
It was shaped from a cultural historys timeline . timeline which remembers all injustice war .
Will we ever see peace come to fruition .
I ca n't help but think about how different my life would be if I was growing up knowing nothing but life with war .
When he was deployed in Afghanistan the kindness of the Afghan people really surprised him .
in the video Rafi . But video Rafi was saying about something more complicated .
He lost the people who he loved most in this world for basically no . for basically no reason .
He told how they invite you in to have a cup of tea .
Central and South Americans tend to be more inclined to play soccer .
The sad part is people do nt realize that regular civilians are being . that civilians are being hurt by the war the most .
War is injuring innocent people which is not necessary .
But if we push the question even further whats the point of doing all these stuffs .
and it did not exist but . Just like the next guy I wish race did not have such a large societal impact exist . but that is not realistic .
and let our view and judgement be clouded by false propaganda . but so many of us continue to fall into the same trap let . We are all taught this lesson when we are young but continue .
It is interesting to me how Sam knew about them because of the Twitter feed .
It shows how innocent these people are and . innocent people are and that war should never be a solution .
and evil needs to be battled with force . I do believe there are necessity for war .
when we were going through a culture revolution . All they see about China was the China 30 years going .
Also seeing the graph of the number of civilians killed each year was scary .
First you mentioned how fortunate we are to live in America .
I really believe that it is a breathtaking realization that each of our personal problems in this country are significantly smaller . than we think .
He tied it back to his religion made the point that continuing to be angry about what happened is not going to change anything .
Is it to dilute the fact that we are over there bombing and killing people who are in reality not that different from us .
everyone to begin to truly see the real meanings behind gestures such as the cup of tea . A common ground of understanding would help these issues to be resolved by allowing everyone .
To me I was always taught that we need to come together and stop the race barriers .
When a tragedy like this is made personal it makes it easier for us to empathize with the Iraqi and Afghan people .
My parents are Indian so maybe I just have more respect for or understanding of Asian people but a lot of this wasnt new information to me .
But should we risk the lives of Americans .
but it did nt feel real to me until the images and firsthand stories were . For myself I knew that a war was taking place in the country feel . until images stories were revealed .
I personally think it will make civilians feel safer in these areas knowing what the soldiers are doing to protect them .
The insight he provided about Afghanistan was very valuable to us .
Whether it be from movies or television or whatever I always thought of Afghanistan as just a big war zone in the desert .
I believe the controversy over dating outside a race is fading out with each new generation .
I can not even begin to imagine what he was feeling at that moment .
I completely agree with what you are saying .
It makes people uncomfortable sometimes including me depending on the topic .
They are being sent into war with a purpose of benefitting people defending other people .
Although Im sure at some point this war has chased families out of their hometown I believed it is often over looked that real families just like us still live there .
I think another reason people do not quite understand soldiers is the fact that you can not really relate .
because nobody really travels there . without even being given a chance to prove themselves because travels . It 's not fair that a culture can be viewed so negatively without given .
would actually be . understanding would . learning and understanding . That probably already exists but something oriented towards learning understanding . exists oriented would actually be beneficial perhaps facilitated by universities .
As education continues to reach the poorer areas of our world i truly believe that one day we will all live in TRUE harmony .
When Sam talked about Rafi coming here with half a suitcase full of gifts that reminded me about how my dad did the same thing .
In engaging with civilians . security forces in Afghanistan LTC Garey . Garey took on a new perspective as a soldier in a foreign land .
I also thought that the class when we talked about race and sports was a very interesting one as well .
He shows the graphical statistics of the military and Afghanistan deaths which all rise high above zero .
Warfighting is something that very few Americans understand unless you are actively part of it .
that one day a country will come in dropping bombs in my neighborhood . This is a scary reality for me to think about because I have been so privileged my whole life by living in the United States that I always feel safe at home and never fear that come .
I know that people have stereotypes about Chinese people but I do like math a lot .
Why would this man do what he does even though he constantly gets death threats why would he put his life on the line .
I am sure that there are many Afghans that are kind at heart like the soldier said .
I do n't think I would ever be able to be as hopeful and . and as optimistic as him .
Then Sam mentioned I started realizing that all the lower end jobs seem to have people with a slightly darker skin .
It seemed like a pretty even mix of all races in every sport we had .
US is not helping other countries by bombing their cities hurting their civilians .
To see that the people were against the Taliban was something I wasnt expecting .
when he raised his hand during the class did make a very good point which . was sometimes people play sports based on availability .
Sam makes us remember that what happens across the seas is tearing apart actual people and their lives they made for themselves .
Living in the US feeling safe seems like a right .
where other people who were Taliban could not hear . This was because the village leader was able to talk to the soldier in an area .
and how their bodies may have adapted to withstand harder working conditions . Maybe it goes back to slave labor for black athletes of African descent adapted .
The elder people in town would even invite strangers to their home for a cup of tea .
For example for many Latinos soccer is the most popular sport . but it depends what country in Latin America .
and getting to know them and their culture . For the most part the majority of his time was spent speaking with the locals getting .
My post discusses some of the same ideas none of us really take the time to educate ourselves on what is going on in the world around us .
such a threat and danger to my hometown . because I have never experienced such threat danger hometown . I think as an American I take my safety for granted experienced .
and I hoped a lot of people would care . I instantly placed myself in the shoes of Lieutenant Garey hoped .
dialogues soldiers cadets . World in conversation andPenn state students facilitating dialogues . World and civilians living in conflict zones is an amazing initiative .
Rafi came to speak with us I did not even think about the fact that people actually lived there and this war was going on around them constantly .
I agree with the quote about how people tend to only remember the bad things but never the good .
Why would he risk it .
it is not them who are involved . They did not choose to be in the middle of destruction them .
Before this class lecture Im not sure it occurred to me that there was such a thing as talking about race too much .
I loved seeing his perspective on a couple different things .
All in all I think this was a very good segment to Sams lecture and sparked a lot of conversation and curiosity within the class .
As Sam showed the number of civilian deaths is increasing .
when he mentioned that his life is threatened every single day . It shocked me when mentioned .
because it can enhance our way of life . I think it is important to learn about other cultures because enhance .
This isnt the right thing to say but I always envisioned Afghan people as the turban wearing gun holding angry extremist people .
I do nt think its racist to not want to date someone outside of your race I think it is all about preference of what the person is looking for .
Starting dialogue is definitely the simplest and yet most effective way to bring about peace .
Stories like . Stories like that sell so I understand why the media chooses to selectively show them .
This is not any individuals fault just simple evidence shown by historical conflict .
I believe until an affirmative action is taken by someone of higher power to put an end to racism we will continue to suffer .
It is imperative that we as Americans see past our own shores and actually try to understand people understand their culture and their way of life .
It is what cements the bond between men in eternal brotherhood unlike any other experience in life .
I think it is very easy to get caught up in the media and . only look at the American heroic view of the war .
However there are people just like Rafi who are peaceful and kind in Afghanistan who were born into the situation and have to continue to live through it .
I think I feel somewhat detached from what is happening there .
If we as a human race could remember those I think we would get a lot more done here on earth .
It allows insight on a country that is thousands of miles away and in a sense makes a connection to us and our daily life .
aspirations that their country will not always be known as one filled with war . It makes me sad to hear that these people have hopes and aspirations known .
because it will be accepted on a greater level . I think as time goes on people will date different races more accepted .
The Afghan people have families they are . they are providing for .
generosity furthers the way I now feel about judging a culture . and currently he ismissing it craving the food the way . Knowing at first he was nervous with people offering him tea ismissing .
I originally was going to write about this topic because it hits very close to home .
and things like culture play a role as well . I agree with your point Callie location definitely plays a role in the sports people play play .
Nothing has made an impact on me quite like this .
It caused us to forget the obvious fact that Afghan people are people just like us .
and I feel like this talk really opened my mind . I only would focus on the people that were trying to do harm and feel .
This land is still the home to many civilians who rely on the resources in their area to live .
Another thing that made me upset was how we do not hear about the people who are trying to do good in other countries such partner . partner who was killed trying to help women just like me have equality .
Listening to Sam speak about the realness of war for citizens in Afghanistan made me realize that I have not been looking at the full picture .
It had been a dream of mine to go and my grandparents had been three times . dream they said they would take me .
That was definitely what I had previously imagined before I joined the military so I can certainly understand .
With the question left unanswered Americans formed a hazy idea of how the Afghan people live but nothing near the comprehensive understanding they really needed .
This man is definitely someone to look up to .
that there are loving and courageous people all across the world . but it made me realize I need to be more open minded are . I know that was not the first thing that popped into my head made .
They simply want their families and friends to live in a country where bullets arent being fired in the next town over .
Sam also . Sam also introduced his friend Rafi . Sam and showed pictures of his children to demonstrate that people have children and a family like people in the United States .
where we did n't talk about race . I just grew up in a household .
All I ever imagined before was a war zone .
turning on the news you do n't see any of the average Afghan people being shown .
I always tried to push the topic of racism to the back of the room in my younger years .
it is also . but it is also difficult to argue that we should take it away as there are powers that threaten us . It is frustrating to see the damage that our actions cause but difficult .
I think the media is a large contributing factor to this as well .
Since it is so far away . it and not affecting our home ground . we should and . as we should and Rafi talking about how much the war has affected him made me reevaluate the way I think about war . as seriously as talking . away we do not take it seriously made .
you have to be willing open to try anything . I too believe that everyone has a type and to find your match or soul mate have .
but I really did n't understand what for . The troops were sent over there to fight for us .
because it is n't getting up on the television screen . Events like this happen all the time and never get recognized because getting .
I think this really taught people not to judge a culture without actually getting to know it .
Although speaking about society 's wayward views on race is a step forward true acceptance of everyone 's races is a feat that may be near impossible .
This lecture showed me what a privilege it is to have that security .
It is sad to see how the number of innocent Afghan civilians killed is rising year after year .
because that is all I have seen on the news magazines etc. . My image of the middle east has always been that way because seen .
The people who you are fighting are often unknown with no distinguishing uniform like in the days of World War II .
and he himself is receiving death threats . He is trying his best to raise a family in a heat of receiving .
We should always have empathy towards people in warzones .
I totally agree with everything you said .
Then she asked us what we pictured when she mentioned the bombs dropped on Hiroshima .
People forget that there are civilians that live like everyone else in these war zones . and thinking about the people of a certain nation at war . the war and to a certain extent the media start to paint a universal image .
The first thing people notice about me is the color of my skin .
if I was living under the same circumstances as the Afghan people . I know that I would have a very difficult time living . all that is going on around them . and I give them the utmost respect for trying to continue on their everyday lives going .
factors have . Media factors have influenced us to not care about people themselves but the population as a number .
but they are there . In the end everyone has different features they may be small hard to notice but are .
Rafi 's family really showed me how much Muslim 's are like us .
In almost every war that we have fought innocent civilian people have been . war people have been hurt .
but revealed that a significantly higher number of civilians in Afghanistan were killed than American soldiers . I always thought more American soldiers were getting killed during the war revealed . the statistics revealed .
It was also said that they are different that people in the US for that specific reason .
I like how you said Afghanistan is a place with with real people .
Therefore I never had a personal reason to be invested in the subject .
The first thing is something that I thought about before but never took much time contemplating .
Simply spreading the word to not judge people based on their race or ethnicity is an easy first step to promoting world peace .
He said if he does n't do it who will .
that most of these encounters were . and that were friendly and inviting in nature . I had no idea that the American troops were in so much contact with the Afghan people friendly .
So this makes it hard for whites to talk about their opinion .
example who was the first person to point out that black people have a better body structure to play basketball .
They have families and jobs . They and loved ones just like us .
Well it is mainly because we cant understand their lives .
Taking the village leaders offer for tea shows a sign of good faith .
People have different tastes . when it comes to dating .
I agree with you that race is not talked about to much .
Caroline I . Caroline and have done some of the things you have mentioned . Caroline I agree with your point done .
We do not talk about racism enough in the right ways .
privilege and is alive and well .
You can not look at history and see a moment where racism hasnt been around .
so I was scared for him to go to Afghanistan during the war . As a kid I had only heard violent things about Iraq and Afghanistan scared .
Children live in these conflict zones and go to school play around with friends and experience a childhood as well .
because they have no one or no thing to help them understand war . A large part of why civilians do nt and will probably never understand what it is like to go to war is have .
it was much more than that . Because Colonel did not understand the customs of the Afghan people he did not understand that what the elder was offering him was not merely a cup of more .
we are simply not in the same . and pictures that the media dresses up for us . we and can only perceive information through articles pictures . This idea leads me into my next point of understanding that we have a hard time connecting .
and reason to work to improve their own country because of how many people from other countries go over to Afghanistan to help with certain matters . I did not consider that people in Afghanistan have even more drive work .
and what they can learn about them . Media has the power to influence how people see other cultures learn .
If you put that in perspective think of how we would being acting if this war was going on here and our lives were endangered like that every single day .
However that does not mean that every means to serve their nation resorts to violence .
In a crowd I often subconscious look at people and think about how I am either very similar or different to that individual .
and I feel I can understand a persons background after a conversation . I have had a lot of experiences with different races feel .
because it is causing mass destruction for really no reason . and I support the end of the war . I am in agreement with Raf .
I agreed with mostly every point that Sam made .
I think you make a really good point .
side know that we are trying to make peace . lets the other know . Culture awareness lets .
In the end I believe it is important to remember we are all humans with our own needs wants and cares .
and think it is just a thing . We as Americans tend to forget what war is think .
The word generosity does not do justice to acts such that .
Sam really got me thinking when he showed us the life in Afghanistan .
and live up to our own conscience . Just to be happy throughout our life time live .
I do not think people understand that this is an actual country just like ours .
because they can hurt really people . But during the war both sides of the troops need to consider the outcome of using massively destructive weapons hurt .
Listening to the stories about the village elders coming out and offering tea to the U.S. soldiers welcoming the soldiers into their homes was something that really made me wonder .
For me I grew up in a very diverse community and school district therefore I was always exposed to all different races and backgrounds .
The Afghanistan war began in 2001 and has spanned the majority of my life .
I did not think that far back to that is an amazing example .
It was very interesting to hear from everyday people in a country that many think is supposed to be one of our enemies .
of this we do n't feel empathy for things that do not directly affect us .
In 2016 there was a huge push including town halls to get people to vote .
of this I typically do nt ask many questions about their deployment at all .
I thought that he used his slides well to illustrate just how similar everyone is and how people in Afghanistan are just trying to get along with their daily lives just like anyone else .
Civilians who can not defend themselves from war .
It all was just very eye opening and thought provoking for me .
however it is these passionate people that we need to make those final votes count .
Just because someone looked different than white Americans how does that make them any less of a human .
and that there are bombings every day . It is different one someone tells you statistics about war that it kills fifty percent of innocent civilians and are .
I personally had not thought about how the civilians have to act sometimes in order to survive all . all that they have .
because we do not know many Afghans . We do not have the right to generalize that all Afghans only think about war know .
What Drives You To Do What You Do .
when Sam invited his friend to talk about his experience as a soldier . I did like invited .
Me personally I do n't know if I would 've been able to accept that at first I would 've been seeking revenge .
Whether it be a large populated city or some small village that lies between two mountains war takes place within the realms of people .
I could not imagine living in such terror .
Racism was always the uncomfortable topic because conflict . it is one of the longest and biggest internal . that seems we can never fix .
War to an eighteen year old kid from Central PA who has never considered enlisting in the military at all just seems like such a foreign concept in a place that does nt haven anything to lose from the war .
but Garey talked about the village elder offering him tea in his home it highlighted that we are not at war with the country of Afghanistan or the Afghan people . It was not in this particular video but highlighted . LTC Garey .
He could very easily keep quiet . and could you really blame him .
and am guilty of forgetting that these places have real people just like anywhere else who want no part in the war . When the word Afghanistan comes to mind I think about poverty death war guilty .
I think that this is something that people forget .
She is helping us start a dialogue in childrens education .
but of ignorance hate they are brought in into the war . These are usually people that just want better for their country brought .
It is also interesting to view issues of war from the other perspective like during the lecture with Bassim .
Today I do n't think most people would think of vacationing in Afghanistan for obvious . for obvious reasons .
I totally agree with what you said that race is beautiful .
No one in my family or extended family has ever really joined the army navy marines etc. .
as we would anticipate . Adam you bring up an interesting point when addressing the fact that many Afghan people who were emotionally damaged did not have as much hate in their hearts .
Personally I am very open to being with someone from another race .
We are simply so lucky to live in such a life . life that we often forget the struggles of other people .
I felt like I did too in that moment .
because it reminded me to think about the cultural differences . This connected me to the people of a war area reminded .
It is such a selfless way of viewing the situation .
However achieving this is not easy feat .
I also had little knowledge of how war affects civilians in their own countries .
Something that we talked about in my discussion group was whos responsibility is it to inform us .
We are the great heroes of the world that is always ready to save the day .
My dad had the same experience with Afghan people they were always generous and hospitable .
Until we experience it our self or at least hear stories we can not truly understand what exactly is happening somewhere else .
I think it is also important for Americans to hear this perspective as we consider what military tactics we are using in the region .
It goes to show that being modernized does not particularly make a civilization happy .
hand became friends with each of them . I think it would take me a while to see what they saw even if I met millions of people of different races first friends .
because it 's almost that the culture is too welcoming for us Americans . that 's kind of upsetting . I 'm sure most of us would n't feel comfortable having tea with a stranger in a village there upsetting .
However assuming we ever fully understand a culture is dangerous and can lead to even more problems .
Its not fair to assume things about people only based on a generalization .
and that he is inspirational . All of this is greater than his fear of the daily death threats that he receives .
Finally the last thing that really struck me about Rafi was his story that he mentioned towards the end of the video .
I know a lot of mixed race couples and . and they are wonderful .
though I still am but I have a different outlook on life . I feel as though am have .
We do nt really understand the extent of the war since our military are the ones fighting for us .
It makes it easier to cope with so much death .
when you are the reason that most of the problems are occurring in said country . Is it even more arrogant .
This is the topic that comes up in class a lot because we tend to generalize that all of a certain group act the same way .
From thinking a man was going to put something in his tea to actually missing Afghanistan is . going is quite the transition .
It is interesting to learn about what their life is like .
I agree with everything you said .
This is not the first time this has happened .
We all need to see beyond the media people in countries like Afghanistan are living their lives like normal people in US .
and what the real world is like . I am not sure how but most of us somehow disconnect from humanity .
Not only do we get the privilege of living without war but are not taught why the war has even began .
I think the main issue though is that we are fighting a war .
I hope one day people will all soon realize that the people there are n't different than the people here .
It was surprising how the Colonel told us that the Afghani hospitality was welcoming .
society better and . and that will hopefully start getting rid of racism . I think that we do need to make the topic more open to help educate society better start .
but that was not apart of his culture . Not only were there possible spies out listening to them apart .
In our own little ways we can find ways to support people whose lives have been affected by wars .
but in my opinion I believe race does not define us . People do not understand that today because life is supposed to be a competition believe .
He was there in the first place to find out who was in the Taliban not to have tea .
which is scary for the people living in that country . Every year the numbers get higher scary .
but it comes with setbacks . as you said we need to embrace it to a degree comes . We can not just ignore race as said .
but it is an interesting thought to juggle . It is likely this could never be fully traced back thought .
but that is only half of the story . I understand that bad thing is happening but half .
it originated he is right that is culture and location . and that more white people lived in the North originated . Sam said hockey is a Northern sport lived . The point that was so clear was said .
I chose the video clip Are Sports Inherently Racist .
I think it has to do a lot with where you live and culture .
It says a lot more about a culture when . its people still welcome outsiders into their home because of their . when it is suffering from war people still welcome morals . and their beliefs .
selflessness this man puts forth every single day I think we all can learn something very positive from Rafi . As you mentioned Jordan everyone should look to this man and realize how much love dedication selflessness day learn .
They are not an abstract concept that live in an isolated bubble our soldiers inhabit every once in a while .
It is both unfortunate but relieving . that I was not the only one who was so ignorant or incorrect about what war zones were actually like .
It was not in this particular segment but eventually Lieutenant Garey . but Garey talks about his meeting with an Afghan civilian .
Is it even possible for there to be no war .
Stubborn as they are you can not change them .
The only difference was the threat of the Taliban and the United States forces looming over the citizens .
Its a shame that those stereotypes exist .
I do n't think my parents ever saw it as an issue that needed to be discussed with me .
This really allowed us to know what living there is like .
but it makes me wonder where this ignorance stems from . Its amazing how Sam is opening up the eyes of so many students but makes .
because I feel like I have continued to hear skewed info throughout my life . I enjoyed hearing about the average Afghanistan citizen as feel .
and terror . It is so sad that they being affected by war .
It is hard to resist if all we learn and know have been filtered .
to his family if . if he did n't try to do something to stop the violence . Who will help bring peace to his country family try .
Another aspect that I think really brainwashes people into having this interpretation of what war is is the education we are raised up on .
Families forged from fire tend to have the tendency to have . relationship as compared to families forged from bloodline . have stronger and closer .
You need to see all sides not just one .
destroy him . Its hard to explain to someone your excitement to go out on patrol to search for the enemy to then close with .
A better . A better understanding of culture allows for a more worldly . eliminates any sort of fear .
Many war zones were . and though they are not meant to be hurt they are . zones were homes first are . were civilian homes .
because that is far from what they are . So we should stop judging them as bad people because is .
because that is where their families are from . Although people may think of Afghanistan of a place of terror and war there are normal civilians who live there is .
and I do hope more people got comfortable with this discussion topic as well . when it comes to volunteering for class hope . But I do agree with you with our class being awesome and so accepting of people comes hope .
issues along the way . We stand up for what we believe in causing turmoil .
Like I said some do not even see the battle field on deployment .
It may not be the safest place to visit .
They probably would not have been thrilled at the people coming into their land . but maybe there would have been some amicable agreement .
I feel like it is time that we see something other than people with guns .
War is a terrible thing and we as Americans need to realize how hard the war is on others and be see it from an Afghan perspective .
Im always scared to bring up some sort of touchy subject or ask a question about something that they do not want to think about .
Speaking to Bassim opened my eyes . Speaking broke my heart .
So then you think what did he do to deserve to live in acountrythat gets bombed and blown up often .
I did n't realize these middle east countries had nice homes or the middle class existed .
It 's not everyday you get to talk to people that have experienced the culture in Afghanistan or let alone a citizen of Afghanistan .
It was nice to see his views of the country change as he spent time there .
I appreciate your post in giving a full understanding that there is a miscommunication with the way people perceive Afghanistan .
When it comes to school a job a sport etc. it always comes down to my race .
We see it pop up in the news often . and it has lead to the formation of anti hate groups such as black lives matter .
and they were growing up in a war zone . Sam mentioned how Rafi was raising his daughters .
I never truly new soldiers may come out of the experience making relationships and building a connection with this opposing nation .
Besides their . definitions they do n't really carry the weight of what it means to suffer and hurt .
and still is for an African American . Personally I do n't think it is eye opening and make a white person realize how hard it is in every aspect and .
The media average citizen should have asked this question when U.S. military involvement began in Afghanistan .
We are taught growing up that countries such as Afghanistan are war torn countries where their cities are strictly for battle .
Seeing Lieutenant . as he talked freely about his time and experience in Afghanistan . Seeing Gary in person was very impressive in my opinion as talked .
I do not see this issue ever subsiding .
Even though there was a con about the snarky comments Sam immediately addressed the situation and shut it down .
but it could definitely stop bullies and promote a kinder society . This love may not be big enough to end wars at stop .
Also not living in that effects area can make you feel very disconnected .
When Sam showed us the pictures of the city traffic mall I finally realized that some of the people who live in Afghanistan are not that different than me .
There were children who were killed families who lost everything and people getting killed for no reason .
and most of us would change something about ourselves if given the chance which is why it was so empowering to hear her say that she is proud to be exactly who she is . In this society we all have ingrained insecurities change .
Thus it is important to learn and listen to realize that people in Afghanistan are real people .
which is beyond unnecessary because . There are a ton of innocent people who are getting harmed from this war unnecessary . because they are just trying to live their lives like myself .
Many families were killed and . families and where basically left for dead .
until we talked about how real people are being affected by this war . Even I thought civilians would be okay since they are not part of the war talked .
It is mind blowing .
rarely if ever does ,does an average citizen spend their day fearing what such an attack could bring .
This being said it is easy to see why no progress can be made with so many countries involved .
but regardless of the evidence Americans will never sincerely accept the fact that they were one of the biggest villains that the world has ever seen . We see it on the news everyday about racial inequality accept .
In the United States we are fortunate enough to not have any war fought on our soil .
far as I can remember out of all of us there was only one black person and one Asian . My graduating high school class had 130 students was .
The question that always comes to mind is why is war a continuing thing .
I also did not entirely know what a modern Afghanistan looked like .
But that was my hometown where my parents were living in .
empathy words are words and situations are . words situations are situations .
I think Bassims story definitely sheds light on the unintended effect of the United States foreign policy of drone strikes in the Middle East .
and result he does n't think that our country has the capacity to change its course . There is a perspective that the American policy caused him massive grieving think .
when Dr. Richards began to talk about the war in Afghanistan . It was .
I specifically want to talk about the war in Afghanistan it is the longest conflict in U.S history .
I never seemed to notice that part about war .
resources yet they have this warm spirit . they and are so happy . I saw these chlildren clothes resources yet have happy . hardly any clothes .
I believe that racism will continue to exist 100 years from now .
When we are disconnected from each other and only see what the news shows us it is easy to get a warped view of what is happening in other parts of the world .
I mean I have heard about it and kind of know who is fighting who .
I think it was good how honest Lieutenant Garey was when speaking about his first thoughts on Afghanistan .
his family . and everyone living in a war zone . My prayers go out to rafi family living .
I also agree with the fact about how just like people in the US want freedom and peace Rafi wants it too .
This lecture was very eye opening for me as . and I look forward to broadening my view on the current war .
They may not have much but . but they are still willing to give and help .
the fact that I am black . but that comes with the history of the country fact . I am from Ethiopia . and when I came here just like most African Americans I have faced certain things but .
I personally had never thought about the implications of war . when it is local .
it was my last time seeing him . and I couldnt imagine saying goodbye to my father every morning like time . I again put myself in his daughters shoes couldnt .
I would say that war can beneficial in its own way but . when it comes down to it war is not . to it is not good .
When is somebody going to take the courage to finally begin to implement actions to solve this .
a lack of worry about my home land . My view on war is simply just a representation of the lack of empathy that Ive been raised to have with such simplicity .
cloud houses buildings torn apart were common responses .
I knew as much as most Americans which is that its a country that has been a battlefield for a long time .
amountof people there are evil . as they are innocent and how asmall amountof evil . This lecture opened up my mind to sympathize for the majority of people in Afghanistan as innocent .
and I would see it in the news . My teachers mentioned it to us and see . but I never really took the time to understand it myself which in this case is my responsibility .
Real people are being affected here .
This most definitely opened up my eyes and showed me how privileged we truly are .
Fearing those people lead us to not giving them a chance to be learned about and appreciated as a nation .
there is no way that all of those people are bad . But that is not true since Afghanistan is a country of almost 35 million people which is a large number is .
Soldiers who had been served in Afghan would have developed a special bond to Afghan .
If everyone is always fighting and arguing the world is only going to get worse .
It is 2017 . seems that things have not changed .
My oldest cousin . when I was young but old enough to comprehend how dangerous a war can be .
Rafi is a prime example that not all Afghans are in favor of the Taliban or the war in general .
Categorizing people makes things simpler but . but it can be unfair .
the home to awful people who target and attack the US . Unfortunately my mind drifts towards the negative ideas such as terrorism violence home .
and I need to work on that . I know I am very quick to judge to an extent need .
I wonder how Raf his wife have communicated their situation to their two beautiful girls .
and this just hit me kind of hard . The very first thing he told our class was that he was a peaceful man .
The next thing the lieutenant said shattered my previous opinion even more .
We need to remove all preconceived notions that are brought about through stereotypes and misinformation from the media .
before he would share information with him . Another story that connected me to the people in war was the story of the man who made LT come in for a cup of .
The fact that our country was founded on racism definitely is a huge reason why we think the way we do today .
This video really opened my eyes up to these concepts of war . video and showed me a different side of war .
However they did not mean every man .
This is one of the most powerful statements Ive heard thus far in class .
They do n't deserve for people to look at them and think they are people filled of hatred when in reality they just want to live normal lives like we do .
Luther King . Talked about Martin Luther King . or even just learning how others can be different than ourselves . and how he changed the lives of many people or learning .
there is never a war in our homeland . For me growing up in the United States I was never directly affected by war simply because our army tends to be always be fighting over seas is .
But when I heard Lieutenant Garey share his story about how individuals were accepting and a man even invited him into his home for tea was amazing .
They are poor . They and do not live normal lives .
and agree with you . I found this point in class interesting as agree .
They have jobs trying to make away just like we are .
This question has been overlooked for too long .
It really was surprising to hear about the constant threat that Raf is living in while just doing his job .
Educate someone to respect someone else and . and there would be no problem with differences .
It is important for speech therapists to understand that so we do nt provide them with inadequate services fact . due to the . that we do nt know something about their culture .
and you are just one person . It seems like a hopeless cause when war person . the superpowers of the world are at .
When I hear someone say Afghanistan I automatically think of war and see images of my parents .
It was just interesting to have the lens switched . and the same goes for Muslims . because obviously most Christians do n't agree with the extremist groups goes .
In your post you raised a lot of good points involving race in our culture .
but what I think is more important is that we can never imagine the influence in between the people after they gone through all these together .
Ive even heard plenty of stories of Afghani families that would invite service members into their homes for a large meal . that and well wishes .
His whole life he has been threatened by the current war in afghanistan .
I say this because Ive never said goodbye to my parents in the morning . Ive and worried about them being assassinated that day .
He did not do anything wrong yet he was targeted and his family was murdered .
I like your quote about how if history repeats itself if we fail to learn from it .
This obviously is n't true because the media does n't . because media does n't portray the positive aspects of the country of what it actually used to be before war broke out .
why is there nothing happening to help decrease those numbers . If people know the number of civilians in Afghanistan being killed is increasing why is .
but I think I would have done the same too . Maybe that was just the military person in him always trying to be aware and smart about things but think .
The conversation between Basim class . our SOC 119 . class is one that I willalways remember .
Going off of what you said I find myself wondering why people do n't just get up and leave as well .
I completely agree with you in the fact that I also do n't believe we talk about race too much in America .
It certainly is visible that more black people participate in basketball while white people lean towards hockey .
The other thing is at my school there were basic sports we do n't have hockey lacrosse swimming etc. .
All we hear in the news today about Afghanistan is related to the ongoing war and . and nothing about the people that are being affect by this war .
Two very . Two very good reasons for war which . reasons which ended up being completely false .
We can not forget it .
and I think that is rarely thought of when it comes to both the decisions of the U.S. and the Taliban . It is affecting the innocent citizens of Afghanistan and think .
and thats the life they know . They are happy and know .
I never seemed to realize that war really does affect real people .
a civilian I had little understanding of what life as a soldier is like .
Learning about the country you are going to occupy should be a requirement for the US military .
was our Penn State reads book It 's what I do by Lynsey . One thing that I wish would have been mentioned in this discussion by Sam was . by Lynsey Addario .
The media is biased to show images and videos of war torn destitute shots .
Throughout the class my small discussion groups we have said that white people tend to be the most uncomfortable and offended . uncomfortable offended when it comes to race which I 've noticed can be very true .
These movies display a Hollywood version of the Middle East that is very different from what it is really like .
Garey was asked the question What thing did you learn while in Afghanistan that shocked you the most . In the video I selected LTC Garey asked .
The first thing that should be established is that we are all humans and should be treated in humane ways .
said this I was taken back at the fact that a majority of this soldiers time was not on a battlefield but simply interacting with others in the country . that he was fighting .
he and from what I saw seemed to feel content with the way his life is now . However Basim he still continues to lead a normal life seemed .
We can try our best to minimize the issue unfortunately there is always going to be a group individual community reversing our progress .
but everyone handles it differently . People all over the world may be going through tough situations issues but handles .
And I also agree with you that maybe the educational system is very Eurocentric .
You are hard pressed to find interviews with the actual grunts on the ground that truly shows you what it is like .
We seem to be taught as a country that all Afghan people are violently vicious mean etc. .
and social norms . These children are brought up learning their cultures values which are often very different from American cultural values .
but I had no idea how important that actually was . I knew that being a soldier was about intelligence training teaming up with the locals had .
If the news would have shown events like this to the general public let them know what is actually going on overseas then Afghanistan would not have such a negative war connotation .
All it took for independence was Mahatma Gandhi . and a few protests .
When I go to Argentina to visit my family it is predominantly white so I use to think that race wasnt an issue .
The men of the town were gathering to discuss the importance of voting .
However mentioned he can not just wait around and let other people take action .
Learning about the hospitality of Afghan people encourages me to try to be a better person in that way .
It make complete sense that the elder his family would be supporting the group that had the most power because in the long run they are the ones that can do more damage should the elder go against them .
values up . I like the part of your response where you say The war may eat such cultures .
I think the fact that we do not completely know the other culture makes it even more interesting to share and communicate .
Like you said the Middle East is portrayed far differently in the media .
Christians believe that the bible is Gods written rules on how we should conduct our lives .
With infinite access to the internet in modern times I too believe there should be so much more accountability for not educating yourself .
Civilians whether or not they want to are affected by this war greatly .
They should have the same experience that we had in class with the two guests who spoke .
However the soldiers interpreted it as poison gas made the decision to kill the kids and put out the gas .
They have the same dreams and goals as us like going to school getting a job and having a family one day .
The point you said about media not knowing everything but wanting the public to think they know everything is really important .
You always see the people with the big guns walking around looking very intimidating .
When he mentioned he was a lawyer in this country trying to create laws regulations to decrease the violence in Afghanistan I began to wonder why .
and getting their day started . However these citizens were at the wrong place at the wrong time walking to work getting . when Little Boy was dropped .
I too have never experienced a college class where social media has been advocated to this extent .
It 's also interesting to see how friendly the Afghan people are to the american soldiers .
I agree with you in feeling outrage at the U.S response to Bassim 's loss .
when all we are exposed to is images of poor children war . as we do when exposed . It is hard to imagine it as a prospering place with families who have the same dreams as do .
What can we do to ensure that war wont affect innocent civilians .
In our Sociology119 class here at Penn State we are giving an opportunity to enrich ourselves with more knowledge about the world we live in .
Bassim has . Bassim has survived unthinkable atrocities as the result of war .
Every war that has preceded this has been fought on foreign soil .
because he does n't deserve that . when asking yourself that question it 's impossible to answer because deserve .
I understand your feelings about suddenly understanding the situation that the citizens of Afghanistan have to face on a regular basis .
I do chalk a lot of the issue up to ignorance .
I think every nation has its own fascinating cultures and values .
We do n't have battles and bloodshed on our own land that 's what happens to other people miles and oceans away .
I cant imagine having to constantly worry about whats going to happen next since its pretty much a war zone .
How could you be expected to forgive a country that bombed your home your dog your family .
I grew up in an extremely safe and close knit community where walking around alone at 11 pm felt perfectly safe .
I am guilty of thinking that way as well .
watching this video the people and events of Afghanistan became more real for me .
I believe there is more to the job of a soldier than most people recognize .
I know from personal experience one of my history teachers in high school made it a point of emphasis to open up class with a discussion on current events .
He does what he does because he feels it is his responsibility .
Learning about other cultures intrigues me . but it seems tough to know where to start unless you can talk to someone from that culture .
and it is amazing to see someone fighting for peace amid all the war . All in all I definitely agree that Raf was a great guest amazing .
If the war was switched and occurring in America we would want it to end to most people would not be agreeing with the ideology of a select few .
Though he is a hero war was a traumatic experience .
When he spoke something that he said had a shocking impact on me .
When he went through that list I was trying to put myself in his daughters shoes .
and states how the districts are split up kind of like our own states . He then shows us Afghanistan broken up into its different districts states .
Afghanistan has bustling cities with crowded streets jams shopping malls just like American cities do .
We always tend to look down at places like Afghanistan and such . there are a few things that Americans should learn from them . in reality there .
I went to a Model United Nation Conference in Washington D.C. talking about South China Sea issues with other American students .
you said . The Tea Story was extremely impactful interesting said . and I completely agree .
He needs to be able to spread his experiences to both civilians and cadets alike .
.
He mentioned numerous times that the great people of Afghanistan are seeking peace .
Just trying to imagine what they go through daily is impossible .
because what is being done to them is something no one should ever have to deal with . me I could not even imagine being in those civilian shoes something .
From an outsiders ' perspective would n't that seem a little extreme .
when you said that US does not talk about any branch of security openly with other countries . I agree with you said .
I have always wondered how would be to spend a day in the shoes of ______ culture .
at the end of the day there are positive sides to the story as well . Of course every country deals with its own issues are .
lash out leading to worse . The constant remembrance of these hard times can lead us to be more fearful lash . to worse situations .
He was more thankful that he is alive today to talk about his experience rather than being bitter about the events that occurred in the past .
I believe a lot of this can be attributed to the way media presents what is actually going on in the world .
They have to appease those in control to stay alive .
All it takes is awareness .
To date I can admit I fail all of the identification games we play and every time Sam calls out to the white people to make a point I am 100 % his audience .
I wish I had enough courage to do what this man is doing in order to help others .
What can I do .
how much do we . And much do we care .
and I do not keep up with a lot of current events in our world . is why I had never put the thought into it . but I feel like this side of the story is never even spoken about is . Now I do not watch a lot of news keep feel spoken is .
and I than I ever imagined . family values which makes the people of Afghanistan seem even more alike to my family imagined . All of these small details allow me to make connections to my own traditions and values .
I do not agree with treating people like lab rats .
Most of this racial tension in conversation results in certain groups not feeling their opinions are worth being heard while . other groups are . while groups are worried that theyll overly offend another group .
This particular story struck me because it showed how important it is for the US military to understand the culture of a nation before they go there .
and I am not sure what to say or do because I fear I will offend someone or make things worse . because I am a white male sure . I have sometimes turned the blind on an issue because male sure .
when it hit me . how similar it was to ours thats hit . When Rafi was talking to us about his life ours .
I think that the media is the major influence on most people from different countries around the world .
I think we need to do a better job at paying attention and staying educated about what is going on in the world around us .
Just one of the many blessings of being born into the right nation .
Yet here we are over 25 . we are . and we are seeing more of these headlines in the news .
why he would stay in that situation . Dr. Richards said Rafi was receiving death threats I originally had trouble understanding why stay .
Whereas in American culture speaking up answering questions in class is seen as a good thing .
Sitting through this lecture has taught me so much and has changed my perspective on war . and what is happening .
So why is it so hard for us to see that .
One thing that I love about this class is that it allows us the opportunity to talk about issues topics that may be taboo or difficult conversations .
I thought this class was particularly interesting because I feel like the war in Afghanistan is an issue that people forget is even still going on .
That is the side of warfare that society never gets to learn or hear about more people should be told those types of stories .
Looking at the war from a different point of view and thinking about how citizens of Afghanistan must feel has really changed my perception of war .
I think the example of India is one of the best examples of the military not understanding the culture they are working with .
The story that the Lieutenant Colonel told us is a very powerful example of that .
He still holds a job has friends and lives his life normally .
So do we talk about race too much .
That goal is universal and is applicable to what people want in the U.S. as well .
Not everyone who lives there is violent .
let other people continue to try to take care of it . He could walk away from trying to stand up against the Taliban let .
Terrorist groups do not need fighting soldiers to be their targets .
He always were jerseys to school . and he loved the Celtics .
One thing that I realized from listening to LTC Garey . that I really think I misinterpreted what being at war entails .
All in all I did really enjoy how I was able to dive into the current news in high school but do believe that everyone can do a better job to educate themselves on what places of war are actually like .
Rafi did a wonderful job of giving our class a clear view into the mind of an Afghan citizen . I thought Ahmad Rafi did .
enough to think that Afghan people are completely different from me and . minded enough . It is almost hard not to be mad at myself for being closed minded enough think . but I am just glad that I gained a little bit more insight about Afghan people from this lecture .
Although I read news articles every day I still do not have a clear picture of what the U.S. is doing in the Middle East .
but I did appreciate how he would talk about modern news every class . Only a minimal amount of the class could be used for current events appreciate .
He is talking about something like a dream a long term goal that might never be achieved in his life time .
In my opinion there are two sides to take .
and that was the extent of it . I always picture war as thousands of soldiers on a battlefield shooting one another extent .
and that will totally lead to different answers . I can think of this question in different scales lead .
I have had many thoughts ideas and pictures of Afghanistan before .
This story highlights the utmost importance of learning the culture of a country .
Race is important to understand and key in making America what it is today .
This man is inspiring .
I think this topic discussed was important because of two main realizations understandings that I encountered .
I also agree that one day teams will look more diverse due to sports spreading out geographically . and traditional ways being . being broken .
The superpowers of the world want them to keep fighting .
and looking would have definitely helped him to be more accurate . but I feel slowing down helped . I am not a expert in noses feel helped .
Instead we create some false picture of maybe what we would rather think .
They have a great culture that I would not thought about learning about if we were not introduced to it this class .
It has also made me aware of the cultural exchange . that is a result of this .
Having no concept of another culture you might be nervous when interacting with someone from that culture for the first time .
Not last year did I first start thinking about the impact of war on civilians .
so that students and people in general can begin to grasp what it is that our American soldiers actually do every day . Teachers should start to focus on these interactions that soldiers actually have on a day to day basis so .
but both have been deployed to Afghanistan . My mom is no longer in the military duty . my dad is active duty .
The U.S . led coalition has been responsible for the deaths of many Afghan civilians that is a fact that can not be ignored as was evident from the presentation .
To me there is no such thing as talking about race too much .
I feel like everyone should be educated on what is going on .
someway he . My only wish is that somehow and someway he finds justice although I 'm not really sure if it would ever make up for what he 's lost .
The coverage of Afghanistan on the news is what really made out a bad image for them in America .
Garey says in this video . When I heard the word Afghanistan the picture that would automatically come in my mind is similar to what LTC Garey says .
They might gave reasons for going but I believe the reasons where just an excuse just to go invade another country .
because that would never happen in the United States if the situation was flipped . It was amazing because happen .
Sam brought speakers from Afghanistan and America I wasnt sure what to expect .
religions is what Sam based this video off of interpretation . The hardest thing to face about both of these books is .
I thought that the class on September 12th was one that I found particularly interesting .
It really makes you think about how trivial our daily issues are compared to what people in other parts of the world are going through .
Therefore I feel it is important that we take our own initiative to learn about what the media will not show .
Im wondering how others reacted to this lecture especially the part featured in the video and . if it pulled at their heartstrings at all .
and some families have been left in the dark . The war has caused American troops to loose their lives .
I naively had the wrong ideas of the Islamic faith thinking that it was a much more complex and strict religion than a religion like Christianity .
Also like you mentioned I think children should grow up learning the war from another perspective .
but I also believe that that will prolong the conflict . It is by seeing the Afghan people as people that we will limit the amount of casualties believe .
His lack of understanding for the culture in Afghanistan delayed his objective in pinpointing who the Taliban men were in the town .
In fact they can even relate and assist our own soldiers .
but I feel that its not the answer to everything . White privilege is a thing statistics back it up feel .
He said social work life are destroyed . and that was difficult to listen to . work economy .
so therefore they would have nothing to worry about . They are the ones minding their own therefore have .
This made me realize that the we are only being given half of the story .
because it did nt affect me personally . I never looked too much into it affect .
He begins saying . that if he stops fighting then who will continue .
I also found this portion of lecture to be interesting .
The idea that someone is different naturally puts people on edge .
This was the first time I wasnt exposed to the radical images of afghan people and for the first time I realized that I was in the complete wrong and I fell into the social norm of stereotyping .
In modern media other civilizations are generally shown in a way that implies certain meanings about them .
Things are not as bad as they . as they seem .
I guess I always knew it was genetics but I did nt know why our features are the way that they are .
To be honest I never understood the Iraq war .
of this it is really hard for me to understand the amount of death that was put into this war by so many different people .
Innocent people are dying while trying to live their everyday lives .
Sams discussion made me think more about religion . and that it might be interesting to read both the Bible and the Quran to get a better understanding of what the books actually tell people to believe and follow for their daily lives .
The only reason that I can tell myself is that maybe were just doing everything for our own sake .
Seeing the photo of Basim 's house after the bombing made . it even that much more real to me .
Im sure that the good people in the USA and the good people in Afghan all agree that we wish those awful people amongst us would just go away and stop ruining the beauty of differences .
until you start to see these perspectives on a personal level . And start it will be hard for the majority of civilians to understand what war is like .
He already changed my opinion of the Afghan people and . that was after hearing him speak for a short period of time .
This was surprising because often times I feel as though people including myself associate regular people living in the Middle East as having a strong political position with the party that is native to their country .
I guess at the time I really did not have much choice to choose from talking race wise .
from taking the time to actually break down these differences in people based off of where they are from really made me think differently about the topic of race .
So why are they only showing us the bad things that happening in Afghanistan .
However it appears it is the opposite .
By hearing people speak about war . and seeing the real people and families afflicted we . that we may not have had before . we gain a sense of understanding and empathy had .
overall culture so they could have a better understanding of who they truly are as a country . The people wanted to teach them their morals religion way of life culture .
Like Sam said the vast majority of people in power are white .
However someone who does nt want to be there will not resist the temptation to be distracted by their platforms and will not take away what the student who DOES want to be there gets from the class .
Race can have hundreds of meanings depending on who is talking .
Real people being affected by war .
and Sam coming together to have him speak to us . and I appreciate him coming . Bassim is truly a great individual .
and I think we can really learn from the people of Afghanistan in that sense . have so little think . I thought it was cool that their culture is about giving even have think .
but at the end of his speech Sam did . The Lieutenant never mentioned the word generosity did .
We live in the country and have soccer cross country basketball baseball softball track .
Once Sam started telling the story of Basim . Sam started and showed the pictures of his house family it really put things in perspective .
Young innocent blacks have been victim to racism by the police for several years now .
It is amazing how Basim is able to forgive and carry on with a purpose which leads to my thought that it is very important for the people who do not understand the Islamic faith to become more educated on it .
and his best friends that were white talked basketball all day every day .
Afghanistan in the recent decade has . Afghanistan has faced war .
I think the citizens and people of a country at war are not always thought about .
Reason being the white person is just imagining that they were being treated like africans americans .
mentioned that he had his own convictions . convictions that were not so in favor of these people .
because it is a topic that has never once even crossed my mind . I really appreciated this discussion about the civilians in Afghanistan because topic .
His home was completely demolished with rubble . broken pieces of concrete everywhere .
Sam bluntly points out how we are all the same regardless of our skin color or our distinctive racial features . It 's really refreshing when points .
Firstly I could n't agree more that society is very open to interracial relationships .
several Indian men conscripted in the British army mutinied led a nationwide revolution to eject the invaders out of India . This simmering discontent under the British yoke is what led to the Revolt of conscripted .
I agree that this is likely due to a lack of exposure to diversity .
but we cant imagine the impact of that . Well see that 50 Afghanis were killed in a suicide bombing at a wedding imagine .
I agree with your thoughts on how little we discuss Afghanistan outside of the war .
I never paused to consider the Afghan people whose homes were being invaded .
My high school was pretty diverse so interracial dating was normal and accepted .
Some people feel so strongly that we have reached a point of no return with the state we are in .
Maybe then it is important that we take some initiative of our own to go and explore other cultures for ourselves .
shoes before engaging . Education would allow individuals to walk in someone elses shoes .
They live such different lives than I do however it wasnt weird to me that they do have such different culture .
We have no power to start prevent or end a war .
such as taking the bus to school or going to the grocery store . things going . everyday things . while doing simple everyday things . It is so upsetting to think about how many children and families fear for their lives doing .
I found his strength humility to be incredible .
Afghanistan is a real place with real people who have normal lives like any other country in the world but . if the war people are living in fear not knowing what is going to happen next .
before he goes to work not knowing if there will be an explosion that could hurt him or his family . said his wife says goodbye to him everyday goes .
not the war . and I feel like it is time for us to inform and show the people of this place . American are being misguided and feel .
Personally if I had to send my biracial daughter to school I would never allow her to go through what I went through .
This man has such strong beliefs demonstrates just how much he believes in what he is doing for his family and country by continuing his work .
The same exact thing that happened to Bassim has probably happened to many other families in Afghanistan but . but no one here in America talks about that .
how easy they have it . You cant always pin the problem on white privilege have .
but it is clear that I was wrong . I used to think the war had more of a negative impact but clear .
I always thought that war was about the United States constantly fighting and shooting the enemy in order to protect our citizens .
saddens me that we live in a world so divided still today .
the incredible bravery he puts forth every single day of his life . Jordan I feel the same exact way about Rafi bravery day .
hearing about the bombing it made me think about how I 'd feel if a local shopping center near me were to be destroyed by a foreign military .
no matter the color you are you see it in everyday life . There is obviously still problems with race in out country are .
If soldiers do not understand about a religion it would be difficult to find the solution to the problem .
In reality we all have the features to help us survive in a certain climate .
Growing up I always read about war .
Cooperation dialogue is not one sided however assuming the other side is welcoming especially in a war zone is a leap of faith at times .
They bounce off of each other and its awesome to be around .
I completely agree that everyone has their own views and ideas about life and war over in Afghanistan .
because they do not know what could happen that day whether it be a bomb or another attack . He talks about his wife saying goodbye every morning know bomb .
and if situation was flipped and our land was being ruined mercilessly we would obliterate them . It is absolutely unfair to the civilians obliterate .
But I think it all depends who the person is honestly .
They have their own word that 's the K word which is super offensive and something you just do n't say if you 're decent but . but it 's still not as serious as the N word .
I grew up in a quiet suburban area unfamiliar with war and . all the . pain that comes alongside it .
Racism is something this country does not like to talk about .
As a participant in this activity I would have to agree that Jeffton did a very good . a good job .
I think that I assume that people from Afghanistan are violent because everything we hear on the news about Afghanistan is war related .
It is interesting that you brought it back to colonization .
Even though we have this great opportunity you can not go on campus a single day without hearing someone complaining about school .
They are regular individuals that have families jobs hopes and dreams .
qualities of other countries was . My first thought to why Americans might not understand the actual capabilities qualities countries . thought was directed toward our education system .
even though there is so many people in the class . His openness to it makes the class so interactive even is .
He was born in Afghanistan and has to continue to live through conflict each day .
and it was awesome to be a part of it . It was an opportunity that not many people have and awesome .
skin and white people cant . when Sam asked about how black people can point out the shine to Jeffrons skin . I was a little taken aback when asked .
No one should ever be scared to live in their own country whiles they have done nothing .
War seems to really dehumanize people .
and that he must keep on living for his son . when he felt that God had a reason that he survived the bombing keep . I did find it inspiring when felt .
Our main mission which has been the main mission since 9/11 is to eliminate terrorism wherever it may exist .
We all grow up differently and every class we have makes me want to be more empathetic towards people before I start making automatic assumptions based on their race religion culture etc. .
He 's one of the greatest people I 've ever met .
However for people living in Afghanistan the war the presence of other countries and the danger around them are a part of their lives .
I agree about the media falsely informing the public about how people in countries like Afghanistan actually live .
I would argue because women are built differently not because women athletes do not work as hard their records on average fall short .
I think it may very well be the case though it is hard to tell .
Elementary school was tough because we learned the basics .
this is due to the fact that we do not live it every day . I agree that conflict can look far away unrealistic at times due .
Blindly doing what you think is right without considering how it might look is short sighted .
I also have changed my perspective of them and realized that they are similar to us .
I never really put myself in someone else 's shoes and thought about how they felt .
was a tragic mournful day in our nations history . These two bombs claimed multiple lives and day .
Hearing about what life is like in a war zone has changed my perspective on my own life .
I grew up in a low income community all my life and looking back the predominate sport has always been basketball .
It took insight from a native to help give him the directions of how to approach the elder by talking over tea .
and it is a shame . Certainly I am idealistic media will always show some bias in their presentation of other peoples .
and that is all they know . Afghans are made out to be individuals who are always in war know .
Every time a civilian is . time civilian is hurt it affects the lives of all others .
Most people seemed very unhappy to announce they did n't truly believe in our Country to pull through this incredibly difficult time we are in .
I can not fully understand it but I do believe it is there .
because Ive heard the same thing that he had that Afghan people were people of war . That isnt the response I really expected from the Lieutenant heard .
I think this man is incredibly brave and I find myself questioning whether or not I would be able to do the same thing .
Here he was in America speaking to us and safe from those threats .
I just do n't understand why that is all we are exposed to .
Even though they are experiencing war they are still generous . they and kind .
A future where all skin colors religions cultures are accepted as one .
We never really think about the little parts that make the whole of it up .
He talked about some small kids that were killed because they were doing a good luck ritual for the American soldiers involving incense .
He told us a lot about what the lifestyle there is like and the constant danger he faces every day .
as though I have taken living in country as safe as America for granted . hearing what its like living in a war zone I feel as taken .
That is the major point I got out of this class .
I was n't even really sure where Afghanistan was . until Sam . where Afghanistan was until Sam showed us the image in class .
I am sad that my friends were treated that way .
There are many cultures have similar policies where they keep open doors and are more friendly to their neighbors .
They never thought it was an issue in our household .
Just picturing a United States in which we walk around worried that well be shot in crossfire or have our houses or schools bombed at any given moment by a person who has never seen our faces or shook our hands scares me a lot but its just a reality that millions of people are forced to live with .
because they do not want other countries to know how they operate . I feel the US does not talk about any branch of security openly because want .
This class . session was really interesting and deep having people with first hand experience of the Afghanistan war in class to talk to us .
those who are citizens of Afghanistan . but also they are threatening those . They were not only do harmful things to other countries but threatening .
In the video on What can the military do . do better .
that when we often hear about a country like Afghanistan we attribute it to the things we are subjected to the news . He made a great point .
In that sense I mean that we are sending people into war with no concern for their life .
I was able to join the women in their dance .
This is a subject that never usually crosses the minds of people who are raised in America because we are so accustomed to the norm of racism that most of us are unable to think outside of the box .
It makes me cringe to think that some place within driving distance of me could one day be turned into a war zone just like in Afghanistan .
It showed me that he really does value us and care about how we feel in class .
I completely agree with you that we need to not jump to conclusions about people or groups of people so quickly .
that the side the local people support is the side of whoever has control of their community at the time . This person tells Lieutenant Garey support .
I think that once people see this distorted image they naturally picture Afghanistan to be that way .
Those lives of young boys who were burning the incense in order to protect the soldiers could have been spared if it were for a simple understanding on the soldiers part .
Peace isnt achieved until either side gets what they want and stop the fight .
Most people do n't get to experience what he got to experience so I appreciated him sharing it with all of us .
faced everyday they did their work . Yet it is a reality Rafi did . and his now deceased partner faced .
discussing so I 'm glad that lessonbrought it to everyone 's attention in class . While I am not necessarily trying to prove a point with this response I feel that this observation is worth acknowledging and discussing glad .
We need to just find a balance .
When we learn about war in history classes it 's more of a rundown of facts .
The fact that they cangracefully pick their lives back up and trek on with fulfilling responsibilities is astonishing . fact and honestly quite inspiring .
For me this particular clip made me think about my own life .
I never understood why people had different colored skin before this class .
The worst of it all is that many of these groups are the most vocal ones but only make up a small proportion of the population .
The amazing part is how Rafi does not HAVE to put his life on the line .
It is almost unimaginable to think about what life in a war zone would be like after having grown up in the United States .
I can never imagine what I would do if I lost everything suddenly .
Like Garey says . says most of his job overseas was interacting with civilians .
The question asked was what did you learn in Afghanistan that shocked you the most .
I have been lucky enough to have never encountered war directly .
Although they are sad it does not phase the attitude and . no matter what they contain to go throughout their everyday lives doing what they feel they were put on this Earth to do .
later on became a non denominational christian . I also grew up catholic became .
It is unimaginable to be in Rafis position .
He is aware his life is on the line yet he keeps fighting the good fight .
The fact that Americas interest in oil in Iraq lead to so many deaths is unfathomable to me .
the way he talked about his family was adorable . I thought Raf was a very kind man and way .
I find myself being completely guilty of that mindset and I absolutely need to change that .
I also agree that there are elements of Afghan culture that Americans could learn from .
I am responding to your post because I feel like you also did that for me .
It is inhumane for Americans to not view these people with value .
There are to many stereotypes that are associated with different cultures which causes everything to be so difficult .
By addressing race we allow input for others who may feel otherwise ultimately resulting in more issues .
I think this is a really broad question .
Many people do n't understand how war affects people 's everyday lives .
and he is a business man . They are very different from one another in regards to there occupation she is an art teacher .
Clearly there are simple disconnects such as the soldiers misunderstanding why the children were running down with incense .
because he opened my eyes to the fact that people in Afghanistan are real people . It was great to have Rafi come and talk .
and then one day having my world turned upside down due to another countrys government . I could not imagine living somewhere and turned .
